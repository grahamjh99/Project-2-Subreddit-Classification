1731942419.0,"NVIDIA is next-gen Blackwell chips delayed again, exposed to overheating issues？","NVDA's next-generation Blackwell AI chips had serious overheating issues in high-capacity server racks. These issues have led to design adjustments and program delays, leaving major customers such as Google, Meta and Microsoft concerned about being able to deploy Blackwell servers as planned.

Blackwell GPUs, designed for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), experienced overheating issues in servers configured with 72 processors, which can consume up to 120 kilowatts of power per rack. The overheating issue forced NVIDIA to modify the rack design several times, which not only limited GPU performance but also potentially damaged the hardware. Customers were concerned that these technical issues were delaying processor deployments in data centers.

To address this challenge, NVIDIA asked suppliers to adjust rack designs and worked with partners to optimize cooling systems. While such engineering improvements are a routine step in large-scale technology releases, they also further delayed product delivery.

I think the overheating issues with the Blackwell chips reflect the technical complexities and challenges in the development of advanced AI hardware, but NVIDIA is responding to these issues with design adjustments and enhanced collaboration. While the delays may have some negative impact on customers and NVIDIA's results in the short term, the Blackwell chips are still expected to be a significant driver of the AI and HPC markets as optimizations are completed and products are shipped at scale.",wallstreetbets

1731930886.0,"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

https://preview.redd.it/6povwnwzcn1e1.png?width=1839&format=png&auto=webp&s=879ebbefc794996c48be08cbb0144c0ee9d675cd

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

My conclusion:

1 bitcoin will always be 1 bitcoin.   

1 bitcoin worth of MSTR will NEVER be worth 1 bitcoin. Accretion only exists when the MSTR premium exists, meaning MSTR market cap > MSTR's underlying BTC. Let that sink in.

MSTR has no levers if Bozos stop overpaying and the MSTR premium goes away. In turn, the rate of accretion (from convertible bonds and ATM issues) disappears. No premium, no accretion (yield).

In other words, the biggest Bozos are paying the biggest premium. This is gonna be interesting to see how dumb the Bozos get at max premium.

This move aligns with the interests of Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO and a prominent Trump supporter, who is heavily invested in autonomous technology, including plans to launch driverless Tesla robotaxis by 2026.

Current regulations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) allow only 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under exemptions, creating barriers for Tesla and other manufacturers aiming for large-scale deployment. The Trump team is exploring leadership options for the Transportation Department, including former Uber executive Emil Michael, to craft policies that could facilitate mass adoption. Bipartisan legislative efforts to increase deployment caps and establish federal rules for autonomous vehicles have faced repeated setbacks, including challenges in Congress and failed compromises during the Biden administration.

Musk, who has been appointed alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead Trump’s ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" is advocating for streamlined regulations and has pledged to push for policies enabling nationwide use of autonomous vehicles. The initiative has raised concerns among rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, whose stock prices dipped following Musk’s announcements.

The push reflects broader ambitions to dismantle regulatory hurdles and advance emerging technologies under the Trump administration, though significant legislative and bureaucratic challenges remain.

1731867370.0,WEBULL FACING CONGRESSIONAL SCRUTINY,"# Chinese-linked trading platform Webull facing GOP scrutiny

NEW YORK POST

NOVEMBER 17, 2024

In the world of no-fee and low-fee brokers, Robinhood is the leader, but it’s facing increasingly stiff competition from an upstart known as Webull, founded by one of the top executives from Chinese-based e-commerce giant Alibaba.

And it’s Webull’s ties to China — seen increasingly as a US adversary — that could pose a major roadblock to the company’s ambitious plans for expansion, The Post has learned.

As The Post has reported, Congress has been demanding information about how US securities regulators are overseeing Webull’s safekeeping of customer data.

Now a group of attorneys general from red states have launched a probe into the company’s ties to the mainland and its ruling Chinese Communist Party, or CCP.

Webull’s ties to China could cause a major roadblock with expansion plans in the US. AFP via Getty Images

The incoming Trump administration, and the China skeptics he’s nominated in Marco Rubio as secretary of state, Matt Gaetz as AG and whoever gets the nod for Treasury, will likely turn up the heat even more, I am told.

People close to the matter say the interest from various government entities comes amid an apparent delay in Webull’s plans to list on the Nasdaq through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.

A spokesman for Webull and the firm’s outside counsel at Wilmer-Hale in DC didn’t return numerous emails and calls for comment.

The concerns echo some of the issues US regulators have with uberpopular China-owned short-video app TikTok — worries the CCP is siphoning user data for espionage purposes since the surveillance state there basically controls every company on its soil.

Both Republicans and Democrats have debated for years whether to ban TikTok, worried about the potential for identity theft, the CCP gleaning “biometric identifiers” and search history of its 170 million US [users.nypost.com](http://users.nypost.com)",wallstreetbets

In comparison, Rocketlab is just over $100M in revenue, but that is projected to grow to $600M next year.  In some ways it is difficult to create a value for Rocketlab based on the SpaceX value, but one thing is certain, based on the revenue number of SpaceX, the market is much larger from a revenue standpoint for Rocketlab than I certainly envisioned.  It is certainly plausible that Rocketlab will be able to climb to $2B - $3B in revenue in the next 5 years even if we tone down that growth rate.

1731788684.0,PENN - Anybody seeing this? Weekly crossed the 50-Day for first time in 3 years...,"The 8- and 21-day MA's just crossed over the 50-day on the weekly chart for the first time since 2021. This seems like a significant milestone for a stock that has been beaten down since it's failure with Barstool during the meme-stock craze.

You can see my other posts for a more in-depth thesis, but some recent news worth mentioning... plus a conspiracy theory:

* Stock is up 30% in the past 6 months, yet \~15% short interest of float.
* Q3 EPS beat, Rev didn't. Lower promo expenses. Lower losses in OSB than expected. Market share not where we want, but path to profitability is improving.
* Former Disney CTO joined the company. As a reminder, Disney owns ESPN so I see this as more buy-in from the Disney team.
* Greenlight Capital increased their stake, it is now their 6th largest holding. Einhorn said ""we believe the market ascribes a substantial negative value to \[their OSB business\]"". And thinks OSB could add $20 per share of value.
* ESPN --- ESPN Bet account linking allows the app to know your favorite sports and fantasy team so it can create personalized bets/marketing for users. Shows further integration with Disney.
* Finally launched in NYC, mixed results for now.
* Multiple analysts initiate coverage, showing it is a player worth tracking. Mixed opinions.

One big deal that no one talks about here is that Disney currently has $500M in warrants to purchase PENN stock. If I remember correctly, their agreement was for 3 years; if Disney doesn't like ESPN Bet's performance then they can pull the plug. Well we just crossed Year 1 and Disney's CTO has now joined PENN, they're linking ESPN accounts, they're seeing fewer losses than expected, and by 2026 (year 3) PENN believes they will have ""meaningful free cash flow"" from OSB. I have a very hard time believing that Disney would rather go through the headache of ripping out all of their integrations with PENN to find a new provider. Like the sunk cost there would be massive and why would they? The just want a faceless tech/casino provider so that they can put their own brand as the name. Fanduel/DraftKings/MGM, all of those would want their own names on the app.

Additionally, and maybe this really gets to the tinfoil hat (I don't think it's as crazy as you might), why wouldn't Disney acquire more PENN stock? It's one of the cheapest casino operators out there right now, sports betting is becoming more mainstream (and palatable for DIS investors), and they get more upside if this thing takes off? The market for OSB continues to grow as more states legalize it and they have a massive opportunity to gain market share. Why wouldn't they want more of that upside?

Look, I've been DCA-ing into PENN over the past year, so do I want this to be right? Absolutely. But there just seem to be way too many tailwinds popping up for this valuation to make any sense with even a remotely successful ESPN Bet. DraftKings has been significantly more unprofitable ever since launching their app in 2018 and trades at 5.0x their Rev, but when PENN is negative it trades at 0.5x (other valuation methods show similar)?

Yeah I don't see that lasting, so I'll buy more. Would love to hear your thoughts.",wallstreetbets

1731783716.0,~$500>$15k ,"3 months ago I put $500 into my account with the goal of seeing if I could take that and “make the small number bigger”. It’s not some massive million dollar gain or anything but I’m proud of it!

My rules were 

1. Try to double the money each of the first few plays
2. Once I had around $2k, don’t risk it all in one place
3. Make enough to actually create a long term position. 
4. Even if you lose, do not deposit any money into the account outside of “Invest with Rewards” from a Schwab American Express. 

I didn’t know much about options, and am still learning but I’ve lurked here a bit and have a few shares in AI & semiconductor companies in a Roth IRA that I’ve had for years (mainly TSM at around $50/share). Most of my gain has come from RKLB, TSM, and GRMN with the GRMN and TSM funding the RKLB calls that gave me the largest jump. 

My work schedule can be hectic and I needed something that I wouldn’t have to check for a few days if I was working during market hours so these fit the bill. I had tried the QQQ thing and sort of either lost or was neutral with it. My balls aren’t big enough for that yet. 

I have a lot to learn, but I’m thinking my best course of action is going to be to take the gains I’ve made, and use them to execute the remaining 8 RKLB calls I have to give myself a nice long term base.

1731783145.0,$BABA - The Azure of Asia-Pacific: Cloud Growth Could Send This Rocket to the Moon 🚀,"TL;DR

Alibaba ($BABA) is more than just an e-commerce behemoth; its cloud computing division, Alibaba Cloud, is leading the charge in Asia’s explosive cloud growth. With Asia’s cloud market expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.4% by 2028, this sleeping dragon might be your ticket to big gains. Let me break it down.



1. **Alibaba Cloud: The Azure of Asia-Pacific**

If Amazon has AWS and Microsoft has Azure, then Asia has Alibaba Cloud. It’s already the #1 cloud provider in Asia-Pacific, with close to 40% market share. The division isn’t just following Western models—it’s adapting to local markets and dominating. Countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are leveraging Alibaba Cloud as their backbone for digital transformation. **A key differentiator is that unlike Amazon and Microsoft, Alibaba has proprietary GenAI in QWEN that rivals OpenAIs GPT offerings.**

Recent milestones:

• +7% YoY growth in cloud revenue last quarter, and triple-digit growth in AI

• Launched Tongyi Qianwen, their ChatGPT competitor, tailored for enterprise solutions, giving them an AI edge. QWEN is ahead of GPT/OpenAI in several categories ([https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/))  ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html))

• Collaboration with ByteDance, NIO, and other Asian giants.

By aligning with governments and enterprises, **Alibaba Cloud is becoming indispensable in Asia’s growing digital economy.**



2. **Asia’s Cloud Market Is on Fire 🔥**

Asia-Pacific’s cloud market is expected to grow from $120 billion in 2023 to $264 billion by 2028 (CAGR: 17.4%; this is greater than the US market at \~12%). Alibaba’s dominance in the region positions it to capture a lion’s share of this pie. Here’s why this is huge:

• Cloud penetration is still low in Asia compared to the West. With increasing internet adoption, 5G expansion, and government incentives, the growth runway is long.

• Alibaba’s infrastructure covers 28 global regions and 90+ availability zones, but its home-field advantage in Asia gives it an edge Western competitors can’t match.



3. **The Cloud Is Becoming Alibaba’s Profit Engine**

E-commerce might have built Alibaba, but cloud computing will carry it into the future. This is exactly what happened with Amazon and AWS. Let’s connect the dots:

• AWS accounts for 70%+ of Amazon’s operating income.

Alibaba Cloud isn’t there yet, but it’s trending in the same direction. Margins are improving as it scales, and with increased AI adoption, demand for compute resources will only grow.

• China’s e-commerce regulation hit BABA hard, but cloud revenue is regulation-light and critical for economic growth. The Chinese government even promotes Alibaba’s cloud adoption for its national digital strategy and helps develop new contracts abroad ([https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar](https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar)).



4. **Dirt Cheap Valuation Compared to Western Cloud Giants**

BABA is severely undervalued compared to its US counterparts. Look at this:

|Metric|Alibaba ($BABA)|Microsoft ($MSFT)|Amazon ($AMZN)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/E|10x|34x|62x|
|Cloud Revenue CAGR|\~30% in Asia|\~20% globally|\~25% globally|

Why? China FUD. But if you believe in the secular growth trend of cloud computing in Asia, this valuation gap screams opportunity. Also, aside from Asia, Alibaba is constructing a new data center in Mexico ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba\_cloud\_mexico\_asia\_expansion/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba_cloud_mexico_asia_expansion/))



5. **The Macro Tailwinds Are Strong**

Let’s not ignore the China reopening play and China’s commitment to stimulate the economy. Add in Beijing’s recent pro-business rhetoric, and $BABA could see significant upside. Plus:

• Alibaba’s $25 billion buyback program means it’s returning value to shareholders at an aggressive pace.

• Spin-offs on the horizon: The cloud division could IPO in the future, unlocking massive shareholder value. Think AWS spin-off rumors but real. Let’s not forget that ANT 🐜 is back!! ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html)); ([https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait))



6. **Price Targets and Risks**

• Base case: $150 in 12 months (30% upside).

• Bull case: $200+ if cloud growth accelerates (70%+ upside).

• Bear case: Regulatory crackdowns re-emerge, though unlikely given current trends. 



**Final Thoughts:**

Alibaba is a rare mix of value and growth with a transformative cloud business that’s only scratching the surface of its potential. The Asian cloud market is exploding, and BABA’s position as the “Azure of Asia” gives it an unbeatable edge. Don’t sleep on this one—when the market realizes the true potential of Alibaba Cloud, $BABA will soar.

One more thing, it’s chairman Joe Tsai is on a winning-streak. He invested $150M of his family fund into more shares of $BABA, and let’s not forget that the NY Liberty just won the WNBA title. The Brooklyn Nets aren’t there yet, but that doesn’t change that Joe Tsai is one very smart China bull! His strategic vision as chairman is up there with the top CEOs we look-up to today ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML\_Vo&t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML_Vo&t=11s))



**P.S. for Key Concerns:**

1. Many of you Apes 🦍 fear Chinese investments because of regulatory concerns and the Republic overstepping. We saw what happened after Jack Ma criticized the financial infrastructure and compared it to a pawn shop. Over the years, China realized that they would benefit from leveraging Alibaba’s technology and have shifted their tone and relationship. Here is a recent article from Summer 2024 in China shared that Alibaba is in harmony with the republic ([https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says))

1. Another key China concern since the election are US tariffs moving to 60%. Aside from this being a negotiation tactic that will likely not come to fruition, international e-Commerce is growing for Alibaba and it is not attributed to the US (\~9% of Alibaba’s international ecommerce is attributed to the US). With news of the Chinese megaport in Peru, South America is going to become a huge importer of Chinese goods TAX-FREE [https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1](https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1)

1731743925.0,How Many Times a Day do You Check Your Investments?,"Every morning, the first thing I do—even before getting out of bed—is check my investment portfolio. It's almost automatic now, like brushing my teeth or pouring coffee. Except this habit doesn’t soothe me; it grips me with a strange combination of anticipation and dread.

I tell myself it’s just a quick check, just to stay informed, but it never is. The numbers on the screen dictate my mood for the day. A green arrow pointing up fills me with a fleeting sense of accomplishment, as if I’ve personally earned that little bump in my net worth. But when the numbers dip into the red, it feels like failure—irrational, I know, but there’s no separating the numbers from my emotions.

And it’s not just mornings. Lunchtime? I’m refreshing the app. Before bed? One last look. Even during conversations or work meetings, my mind drifts back to the portfolio, wondering if the market has shifted since the last time I checked.

I know it’s unhealthy. I know markets fluctuate and that long-term gains matter more than daily movements. I know I’m supposed to stay the course and trust the process. But knowing doesn’t stop the compulsive urge. It’s like I’m chasing some elusive control over a system I have no real power over.

The worst part? It doesn’t even feel productive. It’s not like I’m making significant changes each time I look. I’m just staring at the numbers, hoping they’ll align with my expectations, and when they don’t, I spiral into frustration or anxiety.

I wish I could let go. I wish I could look less, care less, and live more. But every time I resolve to step back, there’s always that ""what if"" tugging at me. What if today is the day something major happens and I miss it? What if I don’t act and regret it later?

It’s a constant battle between logic and compulsion, between trust and fear. And most days, the screen wins.

Thesis:

Pros:
-DAU growth surging. Google realizes their search sucks and is sending droves of people to Reddit. 

-Ad revenue growing strongly. They are finally figuring out how to monetize the site after 2 decades.

-Subreddits have very specific niches and are pure gold to advertisers. Want to advertise to NJ moms that enjoy eating grilled lobsters while wearing fluorescent green thongs? There’s probably a subreddit with 20,000 members floating around.

-Licensing reams of data to LLM/AI companies. This can be thought of a very high margin annuity as data can go stale and needs to keep pouring in.

-AI is efficiently translating all the English content to other languages, which will cause an explosion of growth internationally.  

-Low hosting and operating costs as mainly text-based. 

-User generated content means not spending billions on creating content like $nflx.

-CFO is solid and actually gives a shit about GAAP numbers and not adjusted EBIDTA BS.

-SBC is something they don’t want to go bonkers on like SNAP. They are very cognizant of dilution. 

-Probably the best place online for brands to connect with customers and to also gauges brand temperature. Very authentic human interactions and discussions due to the huge amount of users and the downvoting system which gets rid of bot replies and pushes good content to the top. 

-Massive moat / barrier to entry. How can it be replicated? Would be extremely difficult and costly.

-Can really start to get a piece of the global advertising pie if they can fix their search function.

Cons
-Google can stop promoting Reddit in search results, which would limit user growth.

-Users that come in from Google aren’t logged in, thus generate less revenue from ads.

-Once they capture the low hanging fruit from running relevant ads, what is the growth strategy that gets them to a much higher valuation ($100 billion+)?

Nvidia is the world's largest publicly traded company by market capitalisation, and its shares continue to soar through 2024 thanks to the explosive growth of artificial intelligence in tech and beyond. As of Friday, Nvidia shares were up 189% year to date, easily outpacing any of the company's chip rivals. shares of Nvidia's closest competitor, AMD, are down nearly 8% year to date, while shares of Intel, which is facing a tough turnaround, have plunged 51%

I've been on and off WSB since all inning $AMD at $5 in the Lisa Su mommy meme days. Some friends sent me the CVNA post from yesterday and figured I'd toss mine up. I tried making a DD post in late 2022 but didn't have the karma sadly. I believe I know the company better than just about anyone that isn't an internal exec.

Buys were done anywhere from $7 to $220. Rode it through a 98% drawdown and kept buying more, at one point was down about $10m on it.

Basic logic:

1. Selling cars online will be more popular over time
2. CVNA was the only large player doing that, smaller ones liquidated (Vroom and Shift)
3. Used vehicle market super fragmented so they're competing against Billy Bumfucks Bad Deals Dealership
4. I had data showing the company was cutting costs as expected and continuing to sell cars even when headlines were saying bankruptcy
5. I held as I had data showing continuously accelerating car sales over the past 18 months, with this quarter growing >50%
6. The valuation math was super sexy if they just didn't go bankrupt and grew.

Overall a fun ride. I think the stock does alright from here but sadly I doubt it 70x's again. I'd been blogging incessantly about it since late 2022 and had numerous of their execs reading. Internet DD is not always worthless!

In the two months since Nvidia broke through to new highs to become the company with the highest market capitalisation, the semiconductor giant will report its third-quarter earnings on November 20 while continuing to expand its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) market.Nvidia has risen a staggering 203 per cent so far this year, and most recently added another 7 per cent, with its shares rising to $143, while Nvidia's shares are now up 7 per cent.

I remain optimistic about Nvidia's upcoming Q3 2025 earnings report. Nvidia's revenues are expected to reach $32.5 billion or more!

The price target was raised to $200 from $145 ahead of the earnings call, implying a 36% upside based on the company's growing data centre business, and Susquehanna's Christopher Rolland raised his price target to $180, citing strong demand for Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips. Oppenheimer's Rich Schafer raised his price target to $175. Meanwhile, Raymond James' Srini Pajjuri lowered his price target to $170, but said any drop in Nvidia's stock should be viewed as a buying opportunity.

1731961482.0,betting big on jnpr: waiting for doj’s green light on hpe’s $40/share offer,"alright, degenerates, here’s the breakdown. hewlett packard enterprise (hpe) is set to acquire juniper networks (jnpr) for $14 billion, offering $40 per share, which is a solid premium over where jnpr is trading now. the deal has already cleared the uk’s competition and markets authority (cma), and we’re just waiting on the u.s. department of justice (doj) for the final decision. since the european commission has already approved, there’s some optimism that the doj will follow suit, but nothing is ever guaranteed.

why does this matter? well, if the doj gives the green light, jnpr shareholders get a nice payout at $40 per share. this move also strengthens hpe’s ai-driven networking capabilities, setting them up to compete harder against cisco and other big players in the market.

but let’s talk about risks. the doj could still throw a wrench into this deal if they have antitrust concerns, and if that happens, jnpr’s stock could take a serious hit. there’s a lot riding on regulatory approval, and if the market senses any delay or trouble, the premium baked into the stock price could disappear fast.

so, what’s the play? one option is buying jnpr calls with strike prices below $40, expiring after the doj’s expected decision. this could pay off big if everything goes smoothly. alternatively, you could just buy shares and hold, hoping for the $40 payout. just remember, if the deal falls apart, you’re exposed to the downside.

1731959902.0,How RFK Jr. Could Make $HIMS Great Again,"**TL;DR:** Investors are pulling back from pharmaceutical stocks as RFK Jr. has been appointed to lead HHS, creating an opportunity for $HIMS stock while it is still undervalued. If RFK pushes to block Medicare/Medicaid coverage of costly anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound, people could turn to more affordable alternatives like $HIMS. In 2022, Medicare alone spent over $4.6 billion on Ozempic, and that number likely ballooned in 2023/2024. As RFK targets big pharma, affordable GLP-1 drugs from $HIMS and similar platforms could become the go-to option.

**Pharma Pullback**

Criticisms of the pharmaceutical industry by RFK Jr. have led to uncertainty in big pharma, resulting in a sell-off. This sell-off has indirectly affected companies like $HIMS, as some investors are unsure of his stance on anti-obesity drugs. Understanding RFK’s viewpoint on these drugs can help us strategize for potential market opportunities.

**GLP-1 Reliance**

After individuals have been using GLP-1 medications for some time, they may need to continue the treatment long-term to maintain its benefits. This ongoing requirement creates a strong and sustained business opportunity surrounding these drugs.

GLP-1 receptor agonists, like semaglutide (Ozempic) and tirzepatide, are widely used for weight loss. According to Martin Whyte, an associate professor of metabolic medicine, these drugs provide doses far greater than the body naturally produces, suppressing the body’s ability to produce GLP-1 on its own. This can lead to increased hunger when people stop taking the medication, making weight regain almost inevitable.

A study published in the **Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)** found that placebo users gained 7% of their weight back compared to those who continued taking GLP-1 drugs, who saw an average weight loss of -7.9%. If Medicare/Medicaid stops covering these drugs, patients will either regain weight or seek affordable alternatives like $HIMS, which offers GLP-1 treatments for $200 per month, compared to the $1,300 a month of the name brand

**RFK's Stance on Obesity Drugs**

RFK doesn’t oppose obesity drugs themselves but believes that the core problem of obesity lies in the poor quality of food in the U.S. He has criticized pharmaceutical giants like Novo Nordisk for their focus on selling to Americans while ignoring the underlying health crisis.

RFK has pointed out that the massive spending on drugs like Ozempic could be better spent on improving food systems and promoting healthier lifestyles. He critiques that while Novo Nordisk profits from Ozempic sales in the U.S.,  its home country focuses on diet and exercise as obesity solutions. His criticism aligns with an agenda to move away from pharmaceutical dependency as solution to obesity.

**Why This Matters for $HIMS**

Medicare spent more than $4.6 billion on Ozempic in 2022, and the widespread adoption of these GLP-1 drugs likely pushed that figure higher in 2024. The FDA approval of drugs like Wegovy as anti-obesity treatments has most likely ballooned spending.

The following chart illustrates the rapid increase in sales of GLP-1-based anti-obesity medications over the recent year. Wegovy and Zepbound sales have skyrocketed, reflecting the strong demand for weight-loss treatments.

[Sales of Brand Name GLP-1 Anti Obesity Medication \(Congressional Budget Office\)](https://preview.redd.it/gh5i5co8qp1e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=aac413829cb8fb15afb8851d3ec0b880810e4e9a)

If RFK succeeds in restricting Medicare/Medicaid coverage for these expensive weight-loss drugs, people will look for more affordable solutions. This opens an opportunity for $HIMS, which offers GLP-1 drugs at a much lower cost via its platform. As mainstream options become restricted, $HIMS could see a significant boost in demand.

* [CNBC Coverage](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/medicare-can-cover-weight-loss-drugs-if-used-for-added-health-benefit.html)

While there are many possible scenarios, my research suggests that this is a path forward. With RFK’s push to limit big pharma influence, $HIMS may emerge as a key player in the affordable weight management space.

1731942419.0,"NVIDIA is next-gen Blackwell chips delayed again, exposed to overheating issues？","NVDA's next-generation Blackwell AI chips had serious overheating issues in high-capacity server racks. These issues have led to design adjustments and program delays, leaving major customers such as Google, Meta and Microsoft concerned about being able to deploy Blackwell servers as planned.

Blackwell GPUs, designed for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), experienced overheating issues in servers configured with 72 processors, which can consume up to 120 kilowatts of power per rack. The overheating issue forced NVIDIA to modify the rack design several times, which not only limited GPU performance but also potentially damaged the hardware. Customers were concerned that these technical issues were delaying processor deployments in data centers.

To address this challenge, NVIDIA asked suppliers to adjust rack designs and worked with partners to optimize cooling systems. While such engineering improvements are a routine step in large-scale technology releases, they also further delayed product delivery.

I think the overheating issues with the Blackwell chips reflect the technical complexities and challenges in the development of advanced AI hardware, but NVIDIA is responding to these issues with design adjustments and enhanced collaboration. While the delays may have some negative impact on customers and NVIDIA's results in the short term, the Blackwell chips are still expected to be a significant driver of the AI and HPC markets as optimizations are completed and products are shipped at scale.",wallstreetbets

1731930886.0,"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

https://preview.redd.it/6povwnwzcn1e1.png?width=1839&format=png&auto=webp&s=879ebbefc794996c48be08cbb0144c0ee9d675cd

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

Wow,  I'm impressed by how no one could answer my questions directly.

My conclusion:

1 bitcoin will always be 1 bitcoin.   

1 bitcoin worth of MSTR will NEVER be worth 1 bitcoin. Accretion only exists when the MSTR premium exists, meaning MSTR market cap > MSTR's underlying BTC. Let that sink in.

MSTR has no levers if Bozos stop overpaying and the MSTR premium goes away. In turn, the rate of accretion (from convertible bonds and ATM issues) disappears. No premium, no accretion (yield).

In other words, the biggest Bozos are paying the biggest premium. This is gonna be interesting to see how dumb the Bozos get at max premium.

This move aligns with the interests of Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO and a prominent Trump supporter, who is heavily invested in autonomous technology, including plans to launch driverless Tesla robotaxis by 2026.

Current regulations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) allow only 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under exemptions, creating barriers for Tesla and other manufacturers aiming for large-scale deployment. The Trump team is exploring leadership options for the Transportation Department, including former Uber executive Emil Michael, to craft policies that could facilitate mass adoption. Bipartisan legislative efforts to increase deployment caps and establish federal rules for autonomous vehicles have faced repeated setbacks, including challenges in Congress and failed compromises during the Biden administration.

Musk, who has been appointed alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead Trump’s ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" is advocating for streamlined regulations and has pledged to push for policies enabling nationwide use of autonomous vehicles. The initiative has raised concerns among rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, whose stock prices dipped following Musk’s announcements.

The push reflects broader ambitions to dismantle regulatory hurdles and advance emerging technologies under the Trump administration, though significant legislative and bureaucratic challenges remain.

1731867370.0,WEBULL FACING CONGRESSIONAL SCRUTINY,"# Chinese-linked trading platform Webull facing GOP scrutiny

NEW YORK POST

NOVEMBER 17, 2024

In the world of no-fee and low-fee brokers, Robinhood is the leader, but it’s facing increasingly stiff competition from an upstart known as Webull, founded by one of the top executives from Chinese-based e-commerce giant Alibaba.

And it’s Webull’s ties to China — seen increasingly as a US adversary — that could pose a major roadblock to the company’s ambitious plans for expansion, The Post has learned.

As The Post has reported, Congress has been demanding information about how US securities regulators are overseeing Webull’s safekeeping of customer data.

Now a group of attorneys general from red states have launched a probe into the company’s ties to the mainland and its ruling Chinese Communist Party, or CCP.

Webull’s ties to China could cause a major roadblock with expansion plans in the US. AFP via Getty Images

The incoming Trump administration, and the China skeptics he’s nominated in Marco Rubio as secretary of state, Matt Gaetz as AG and whoever gets the nod for Treasury, will likely turn up the heat even more, I am told.

People close to the matter say the interest from various government entities comes amid an apparent delay in Webull’s plans to list on the Nasdaq through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.

A spokesman for Webull and the firm’s outside counsel at Wilmer-Hale in DC didn’t return numerous emails and calls for comment.

The concerns echo some of the issues US regulators have with uberpopular China-owned short-video app TikTok — worries the CCP is siphoning user data for espionage purposes since the surveillance state there basically controls every company on its soil.

Both Republicans and Democrats have debated for years whether to ban TikTok, worried about the potential for identity theft, the CCP gleaning “biometric identifiers” and search history of its 170 million US [users.nypost.com](http://users.nypost.com)",wallstreetbets

In comparison, Rocketlab is just over $100M in revenue, but that is projected to grow to $600M next year.  In some ways it is difficult to create a value for Rocketlab based on the SpaceX value, but one thing is certain, based on the revenue number of SpaceX, the market is much larger from a revenue standpoint for Rocketlab than I certainly envisioned.  It is certainly plausible that Rocketlab will be able to climb to $2B - $3B in revenue in the next 5 years even if we tone down that growth rate.

Ok... going to try this again.

My first attempt was rejected because of 'no text' when I had written an entire page reflecting on my five years.. Oh well, you regards wouldn't have read it all anyways.

I included my gains as well as my losses and there are some good ones in there for your viewing pleasure.

I left a great career in 2019 (right before Covid) and what you are seeing are the fruits of my labour for the past five years. I didn't really plan to trade full time... but it happened and I love it.

The starting capital was my pension payout.

We are in a super interesting period with lots of volatility combined with a President who measures his performance on stock market returns and this bodes well for us. I think...

Up or down doesn't matter.

Good luck out there.

1731788684.0,PENN - Anybody seeing this? Weekly crossed the 50-Day for first time in 3 years...,"The 8- and 21-day MA's just crossed over the 50-day on the weekly chart for the first time since 2021. This seems like a significant milestone for a stock that has been beaten down since it's failure with Barstool during the meme-stock craze.

You can see my other posts for a more in-depth thesis, but some recent news worth mentioning... plus a conspiracy theory:

* Stock is up 30% in the past 6 months, yet \~15% short interest of float.
* Q3 EPS beat, Rev didn't. Lower promo expenses. Lower losses in OSB than expected. Market share not where we want, but path to profitability is improving.
* Former Disney CTO joined the company. As a reminder, Disney owns ESPN so I see this as more buy-in from the Disney team.
* Greenlight Capital increased their stake, it is now their 6th largest holding. Einhorn said ""we believe the market ascribes a substantial negative value to \[their OSB business\]"". And thinks OSB could add $20 per share of value.
* ESPN --- ESPN Bet account linking allows the app to know your favorite sports and fantasy team so it can create personalized bets/marketing for users. Shows further integration with Disney.
* Finally launched in NYC, mixed results for now.
* Multiple analysts initiate coverage, showing it is a player worth tracking. Mixed opinions.

One big deal that no one talks about here is that Disney currently has $500M in warrants to purchase PENN stock. If I remember correctly, their agreement was for 3 years; if Disney doesn't like ESPN Bet's performance then they can pull the plug. Well we just crossed Year 1 and Disney's CTO has now joined PENN, they're linking ESPN accounts, they're seeing fewer losses than expected, and by 2026 (year 3) PENN believes they will have ""meaningful free cash flow"" from OSB. I have a very hard time believing that Disney would rather go through the headache of ripping out all of their integrations with PENN to find a new provider. Like the sunk cost there would be massive and why would they? The just want a faceless tech/casino provider so that they can put their own brand as the name. Fanduel/DraftKings/MGM, all of those would want their own names on the app.

Additionally, and maybe this really gets to the tinfoil hat (I don't think it's as crazy as you might), why wouldn't Disney acquire more PENN stock? It's one of the cheapest casino operators out there right now, sports betting is becoming more mainstream (and palatable for DIS investors), and they get more upside if this thing takes off? The market for OSB continues to grow as more states legalize it and they have a massive opportunity to gain market share. Why wouldn't they want more of that upside?

Look, I've been DCA-ing into PENN over the past year, so do I want this to be right? Absolutely. But there just seem to be way too many tailwinds popping up for this valuation to make any sense with even a remotely successful ESPN Bet. DraftKings has been significantly more unprofitable ever since launching their app in 2018 and trades at 5.0x their Rev, but when PENN is negative it trades at 0.5x (other valuation methods show similar)?

Yeah I don't see that lasting, so I'll buy more. Would love to hear your thoughts.",wallstreetbets

1731783716.0,~$500>$15k ,"3 months ago I put $500 into my account with the goal of seeing if I could take that and “make the small number bigger”. It’s not some massive million dollar gain or anything but I’m proud of it!

My rules were 

1. Try to double the money each of the first few plays
2. Once I had around $2k, don’t risk it all in one place
3. Make enough to actually create a long term position. 
4. Even if you lose, do not deposit any money into the account outside of “Invest with Rewards” from a Schwab American Express. 

I didn’t know much about options, and am still learning but I’ve lurked here a bit and have a few shares in AI & semiconductor companies in a Roth IRA that I’ve had for years (mainly TSM at around $50/share). Most of my gain has come from RKLB, TSM, and GRMN with the GRMN and TSM funding the RKLB calls that gave me the largest jump. 

My work schedule can be hectic and I needed something that I wouldn’t have to check for a few days if I was working during market hours so these fit the bill. I had tried the QQQ thing and sort of either lost or was neutral with it. My balls aren’t big enough for that yet. 

I have a lot to learn, but I’m thinking my best course of action is going to be to take the gains I’ve made, and use them to execute the remaining 8 RKLB calls I have to give myself a nice long term base.

1731783145.0,$BABA - The Azure of Asia-Pacific: Cloud Growth Could Send This Rocket to the Moon 🚀,"TL;DR

Alibaba ($BABA) is more than just an e-commerce behemoth; its cloud computing division, Alibaba Cloud, is leading the charge in Asia’s explosive cloud growth. With Asia’s cloud market expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.4% by 2028, this sleeping dragon might be your ticket to big gains. Let me break it down.



1. **Alibaba Cloud: The Azure of Asia-Pacific**

If Amazon has AWS and Microsoft has Azure, then Asia has Alibaba Cloud. It’s already the #1 cloud provider in Asia-Pacific, with close to 40% market share. The division isn’t just following Western models—it’s adapting to local markets and dominating. Countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are leveraging Alibaba Cloud as their backbone for digital transformation. **A key differentiator is that unlike Amazon and Microsoft, Alibaba has proprietary GenAI in QWEN that rivals OpenAIs GPT offerings.**

Recent milestones:

• +7% YoY growth in cloud revenue last quarter, and triple-digit growth in AI

• Launched Tongyi Qianwen, their ChatGPT competitor, tailored for enterprise solutions, giving them an AI edge. QWEN is ahead of GPT/OpenAI in several categories ([https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/))  ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html))

• Collaboration with ByteDance, NIO, and other Asian giants.

By aligning with governments and enterprises, **Alibaba Cloud is becoming indispensable in Asia’s growing digital economy.**



2. **Asia’s Cloud Market Is on Fire 🔥**

Asia-Pacific’s cloud market is expected to grow from $120 billion in 2023 to $264 billion by 2028 (CAGR: 17.4%; this is greater than the US market at \~12%). Alibaba’s dominance in the region positions it to capture a lion’s share of this pie. Here’s why this is huge:

• Cloud penetration is still low in Asia compared to the West. With increasing internet adoption, 5G expansion, and government incentives, the growth runway is long.

• Alibaba’s infrastructure covers 28 global regions and 90+ availability zones, but its home-field advantage in Asia gives it an edge Western competitors can’t match.



3. **The Cloud Is Becoming Alibaba’s Profit Engine**

E-commerce might have built Alibaba, but cloud computing will carry it into the future. This is exactly what happened with Amazon and AWS. Let’s connect the dots:

• AWS accounts for 70%+ of Amazon’s operating income.

Alibaba Cloud isn’t there yet, but it’s trending in the same direction. Margins are improving as it scales, and with increased AI adoption, demand for compute resources will only grow.

• China’s e-commerce regulation hit BABA hard, but cloud revenue is regulation-light and critical for economic growth. The Chinese government even promotes Alibaba’s cloud adoption for its national digital strategy and helps develop new contracts abroad ([https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar](https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar)).



4. **Dirt Cheap Valuation Compared to Western Cloud Giants**

BABA is severely undervalued compared to its US counterparts. Look at this:

|Metric|Alibaba ($BABA)|Microsoft ($MSFT)|Amazon ($AMZN)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/E|10x|34x|62x|
|Cloud Revenue CAGR|\~30% in Asia|\~20% globally|\~25% globally|

Why? China FUD. But if you believe in the secular growth trend of cloud computing in Asia, this valuation gap screams opportunity. Also, aside from Asia, Alibaba is constructing a new data center in Mexico ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba\_cloud\_mexico\_asia\_expansion/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba_cloud_mexico_asia_expansion/))



5. **The Macro Tailwinds Are Strong**

Let’s not ignore the China reopening play and China’s commitment to stimulate the economy. Add in Beijing’s recent pro-business rhetoric, and $BABA could see significant upside. Plus:

• Alibaba’s $25 billion buyback program means it’s returning value to shareholders at an aggressive pace.

• Spin-offs on the horizon: The cloud division could IPO in the future, unlocking massive shareholder value. Think AWS spin-off rumors but real. Let’s not forget that ANT 🐜 is back!! ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html)); ([https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait))



6. **Price Targets and Risks**

• Base case: $150 in 12 months (30% upside).

• Bull case: $200+ if cloud growth accelerates (70%+ upside).

• Bear case: Regulatory crackdowns re-emerge, though unlikely given current trends. 



**Final Thoughts:**

Alibaba is a rare mix of value and growth with a transformative cloud business that’s only scratching the surface of its potential. The Asian cloud market is exploding, and BABA’s position as the “Azure of Asia” gives it an unbeatable edge. Don’t sleep on this one—when the market realizes the true potential of Alibaba Cloud, $BABA will soar.

One more thing, it’s chairman Joe Tsai is on a winning-streak. He invested $150M of his family fund into more shares of $BABA, and let’s not forget that the NY Liberty just won the WNBA title. The Brooklyn Nets aren’t there yet, but that doesn’t change that Joe Tsai is one very smart China bull! His strategic vision as chairman is up there with the top CEOs we look-up to today ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML\_Vo&t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML_Vo&t=11s))



**P.S. for Key Concerns:**

1. Many of you Apes 🦍 fear Chinese investments because of regulatory concerns and the Republic overstepping. We saw what happened after Jack Ma criticized the financial infrastructure and compared it to a pawn shop. Over the years, China realized that they would benefit from leveraging Alibaba’s technology and have shifted their tone and relationship. Here is a recent article from Summer 2024 in China shared that Alibaba is in harmony with the republic ([https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says))

1. Another key China concern since the election are US tariffs moving to 60%. Aside from this being a negotiation tactic that will likely not come to fruition, international e-Commerce is growing for Alibaba and it is not attributed to the US (\~9% of Alibaba’s international ecommerce is attributed to the US). With news of the Chinese megaport in Peru, South America is going to become a huge importer of Chinese goods TAX-FREE [https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1](https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1)

1731743925.0,How Many Times a Day do You Check Your Investments?,"Every morning, the first thing I do—even before getting out of bed—is check my investment portfolio. It's almost automatic now, like brushing my teeth or pouring coffee. Except this habit doesn’t soothe me; it grips me with a strange combination of anticipation and dread.

I tell myself it’s just a quick check, just to stay informed, but it never is. The numbers on the screen dictate my mood for the day. A green arrow pointing up fills me with a fleeting sense of accomplishment, as if I’ve personally earned that little bump in my net worth. But when the numbers dip into the red, it feels like failure—irrational, I know, but there’s no separating the numbers from my emotions.

And it’s not just mornings. Lunchtime? I’m refreshing the app. Before bed? One last look. Even during conversations or work meetings, my mind drifts back to the portfolio, wondering if the market has shifted since the last time I checked.

I know it’s unhealthy. I know markets fluctuate and that long-term gains matter more than daily movements. I know I’m supposed to stay the course and trust the process. But knowing doesn’t stop the compulsive urge. It’s like I’m chasing some elusive control over a system I have no real power over.

The worst part? It doesn’t even feel productive. It’s not like I’m making significant changes each time I look. I’m just staring at the numbers, hoping they’ll align with my expectations, and when they don’t, I spiral into frustration or anxiety.

I wish I could let go. I wish I could look less, care less, and live more. But every time I resolve to step back, there’s always that ""what if"" tugging at me. What if today is the day something major happens and I miss it? What if I don’t act and regret it later?

It’s a constant battle between logic and compulsion, between trust and fear. And most days, the screen wins.

Thesis:

Pros:
-DAU growth surging. Google realizes their search sucks and is sending droves of people to Reddit. 

-Ad revenue growing strongly. They are finally figuring out how to monetize the site after 2 decades.

-Subreddits have very specific niches and are pure gold to advertisers. Want to advertise to NJ moms that enjoy eating grilled lobsters while wearing fluorescent green thongs? There’s probably a subreddit with 20,000 members floating around.

-Licensing reams of data to LLM/AI companies. This can be thought of a very high margin annuity as data can go stale and needs to keep pouring in.

-AI is efficiently translating all the English content to other languages, which will cause an explosion of growth internationally.  

-Low hosting and operating costs as mainly text-based. 

-User generated content means not spending billions on creating content like $nflx.

-CFO is solid and actually gives a shit about GAAP numbers and not adjusted EBIDTA BS.

-SBC is something they don’t want to go bonkers on like SNAP. They are very cognizant of dilution. 

-Probably the best place online for brands to connect with customers and to also gauges brand temperature. Very authentic human interactions and discussions due to the huge amount of users and the downvoting system which gets rid of bot replies and pushes good content to the top. 

-Massive moat / barrier to entry. How can it be replicated? Would be extremely difficult and costly.

-Can really start to get a piece of the global advertising pie if they can fix their search function.

Cons
-Google can stop promoting Reddit in search results, which would limit user growth.

-Users that come in from Google aren’t logged in, thus generate less revenue from ads.

-Once they capture the low hanging fruit from running relevant ads, what is the growth strategy that gets them to a much higher valuation ($100 billion+)?

80 87.5C 8/15/2025 @ 6.58 avg (~52k)

DD:

TLDR; Walmart is poised to easily gain +20-30% over the next year. In conjunction with incredibly cheap LEAPs (20% IV) this means the potential for two caniac combos worth of tendies. 

The Overview 
Walmart has seen almost a 30% gain since last earnings as investors are piling in on the presumption that increased automation and E-Commerce will improve top and bottom lines. What is less talked about right now is the effect the Trump administration will have on Walmart and its domestic competitors. Walmart sources almost 2/3s of its products domestically in the US. In fact, Walmart has direct relationships with US suppliers and manufacturers— this has been a core part of their business model in limiting costs (and food prices, as we will get to). Walmarts competitors, however, mostly source abroad: Target for example has almost 49% of its supplying factories based in China alone. Yea, that’s right— the same China Trump wants to slap massive import tariffs on. So what happens when Walmarts competitors raise prices? Well, there’s a couple options (all of which are either favorable or neutral to Walmart). Either A) Competitors raise prices; Walmart does not on its domestic products and they subsequently capture a much larger market share as consumers flock to cheap Walmart name brand goods (tendies) B) Competitors raise prices and Walmart uses it as an excuse to raise prices as well; profit margins go up while market share stays approximately the same (tendies) or C) this analysis is wrong and Walmart is hit just as hard as its competitors; the automation, E-Commerce platforms, and foreign markets Walmart is attempting to get market share in (and the market is obsessed with) continue to bear fruit, and we are left either up or approximately the same (kids meal tendies). This is in conjunction with the fact that Walmart has reported that consumers from all income strata have already begun switching to Walmart items from competitor’s stores (read, brand loyalty is in the gutter) making any price discrepancies between Walmart and its competitors have a magnified effect on consumer demand. 

Execution:
But why the hell would I yolo in Walmart which might only go up 20-30% if you are right instead of other, juicier stocks that could move more? It’s because the relative stability of Walmart’s stock over the past several years works massively in our favor. 7 month ATM LEAPS are priced with 20% IV in mind (+10% break even), or roughly 6.50 per option. You regards spend more time value premium on a Tesla monthly call than a year long Walmart one. This means we can eliminate much of the risk of this DD (timing the market) and exaggerate the gains from that “small” 20-30% move. We are talking a 3-4x of your investment from a -mostly- theta safe investment. And remember, that’s from at the money LEAPS. This is what makes this investment choice such a juicy opportunity for us.",wallstreetbets

1731961482.0,betting big on jnpr: waiting for doj’s green light on hpe’s $40/share offer,"alright, degenerates, here’s the breakdown. hewlett packard enterprise (hpe) is set to acquire juniper networks (jnpr) for $14 billion, offering $40 per share, which is a solid premium over where jnpr is trading now. the deal has already cleared the uk’s competition and markets authority (cma), and we’re just waiting on the u.s. department of justice (doj) for the final decision. since the european commission has already approved, there’s some optimism that the doj will follow suit, but nothing is ever guaranteed.

why does this matter? well, if the doj gives the green light, jnpr shareholders get a nice payout at $40 per share. this move also strengthens hpe’s ai-driven networking capabilities, setting them up to compete harder against cisco and other big players in the market.

but let’s talk about risks. the doj could still throw a wrench into this deal if they have antitrust concerns, and if that happens, jnpr’s stock could take a serious hit. there’s a lot riding on regulatory approval, and if the market senses any delay or trouble, the premium baked into the stock price could disappear fast.

so, what’s the play? one option is buying jnpr calls with strike prices below $40, expiring after the doj’s expected decision. this could pay off big if everything goes smoothly. alternatively, you could just buy shares and hold, hoping for the $40 payout. just remember, if the deal falls apart, you’re exposed to the downside.

1731959902.0,How RFK Jr. Could Make $HIMS Great Again,"**TL;DR:** Investors are pulling back from pharmaceutical stocks as RFK Jr. has been appointed to lead HHS, creating an opportunity for $HIMS stock while it is still undervalued. If RFK pushes to block Medicare/Medicaid coverage of costly anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound, people could turn to more affordable alternatives like $HIMS. In 2022, Medicare alone spent over $4.6 billion on Ozempic, and that number likely ballooned in 2023/2024. As RFK targets big pharma, affordable GLP-1 drugs from $HIMS and similar platforms could become the go-to option.

**Pharma Pullback**

Criticisms of the pharmaceutical industry by RFK Jr. have led to uncertainty in big pharma, resulting in a sell-off. This sell-off has indirectly affected companies like $HIMS, as some investors are unsure of his stance on anti-obesity drugs. Understanding RFK’s viewpoint on these drugs can help us strategize for potential market opportunities.

**GLP-1 Reliance**

After individuals have been using GLP-1 medications for some time, they may need to continue the treatment long-term to maintain its benefits. This ongoing requirement creates a strong and sustained business opportunity surrounding these drugs.

GLP-1 receptor agonists, like semaglutide (Ozempic) and tirzepatide, are widely used for weight loss. According to Martin Whyte, an associate professor of metabolic medicine, these drugs provide doses far greater than the body naturally produces, suppressing the body’s ability to produce GLP-1 on its own. This can lead to increased hunger when people stop taking the medication, making weight regain almost inevitable.

A study published in the **Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)** found that placebo users gained 7% of their weight back compared to those who continued taking GLP-1 drugs, who saw an average weight loss of -7.9%. If Medicare/Medicaid stops covering these drugs, patients will either regain weight or seek affordable alternatives like $HIMS, which offers GLP-1 treatments for $200 per month, compared to the $1,300 a month of the name brand

**RFK's Stance on Obesity Drugs**

RFK doesn’t oppose obesity drugs themselves but believes that the core problem of obesity lies in the poor quality of food in the U.S. He has criticized pharmaceutical giants like Novo Nordisk for their focus on selling to Americans while ignoring the underlying health crisis.

RFK has pointed out that the massive spending on drugs like Ozempic could be better spent on improving food systems and promoting healthier lifestyles. He critiques that while Novo Nordisk profits from Ozempic sales in the U.S.,  its home country focuses on diet and exercise as obesity solutions. His criticism aligns with an agenda to move away from pharmaceutical dependency as solution to obesity.

**Why This Matters for $HIMS**

Medicare spent more than $4.6 billion on Ozempic in 2022, and the widespread adoption of these GLP-1 drugs likely pushed that figure higher in 2024. The FDA approval of drugs like Wegovy as anti-obesity treatments has most likely ballooned spending.

The following chart illustrates the rapid increase in sales of GLP-1-based anti-obesity medications over the recent year. Wegovy and Zepbound sales have skyrocketed, reflecting the strong demand for weight-loss treatments.

[Sales of Brand Name GLP-1 Anti Obesity Medication \(Congressional Budget Office\)](https://preview.redd.it/gh5i5co8qp1e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=aac413829cb8fb15afb8851d3ec0b880810e4e9a)

If RFK succeeds in restricting Medicare/Medicaid coverage for these expensive weight-loss drugs, people will look for more affordable solutions. This opens an opportunity for $HIMS, which offers GLP-1 drugs at a much lower cost via its platform. As mainstream options become restricted, $HIMS could see a significant boost in demand.

* [CNBC Coverage](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/medicare-can-cover-weight-loss-drugs-if-used-for-added-health-benefit.html)

While there are many possible scenarios, my research suggests that this is a path forward. With RFK’s push to limit big pharma influence, $HIMS may emerge as a key player in the affordable weight management space.

1731942419.0,"NVIDIA is next-gen Blackwell chips delayed again, exposed to overheating issues？","NVDA's next-generation Blackwell AI chips had serious overheating issues in high-capacity server racks. These issues have led to design adjustments and program delays, leaving major customers such as Google, Meta and Microsoft concerned about being able to deploy Blackwell servers as planned.

Blackwell GPUs, designed for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), experienced overheating issues in servers configured with 72 processors, which can consume up to 120 kilowatts of power per rack. The overheating issue forced NVIDIA to modify the rack design several times, which not only limited GPU performance but also potentially damaged the hardware. Customers were concerned that these technical issues were delaying processor deployments in data centers.

To address this challenge, NVIDIA asked suppliers to adjust rack designs and worked with partners to optimize cooling systems. While such engineering improvements are a routine step in large-scale technology releases, they also further delayed product delivery.

I think the overheating issues with the Blackwell chips reflect the technical complexities and challenges in the development of advanced AI hardware, but NVIDIA is responding to these issues with design adjustments and enhanced collaboration. While the delays may have some negative impact on customers and NVIDIA's results in the short term, the Blackwell chips are still expected to be a significant driver of the AI and HPC markets as optimizations are completed and products are shipped at scale.",wallstreetbets

I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

Wow,  I'm impressed by how no one could answer my questions directly.

My conclusion:

1 bitcoin will always be 1 bitcoin.   

1 bitcoin worth of MSTR will NEVER be worth 1 bitcoin. Accretion only exists when the MSTR premium exists, meaning MSTR market cap > MSTR's underlying BTC. Let that sink in.

MSTR has no levers if Bozos stop overpaying and the MSTR premium goes away. In turn, the rate of accretion (from convertible bonds and ATM issues) disappears. No premium, no accretion (yield).

In other words, the biggest Bozos are paying the biggest premium. This is gonna be interesting to see how dumb the Bozos get at max premium.

This move aligns with the interests of Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO and a prominent Trump supporter, who is heavily invested in autonomous technology, including plans to launch driverless Tesla robotaxis by 2026.

Current regulations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) allow only 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under exemptions, creating barriers for Tesla and other manufacturers aiming for large-scale deployment. The Trump team is exploring leadership options for the Transportation Department, including former Uber executive Emil Michael, to craft policies that could facilitate mass adoption. Bipartisan legislative efforts to increase deployment caps and establish federal rules for autonomous vehicles have faced repeated setbacks, including challenges in Congress and failed compromises during the Biden administration.

Musk, who has been appointed alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead Trump’s ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" is advocating for streamlined regulations and has pledged to push for policies enabling nationwide use of autonomous vehicles. The initiative has raised concerns among rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, whose stock prices dipped following Musk’s announcements.

The push reflects broader ambitions to dismantle regulatory hurdles and advance emerging technologies under the Trump administration, though significant legislative and bureaucratic challenges remain.

1731867370.0,WEBULL FACING CONGRESSIONAL SCRUTINY,"# Chinese-linked trading platform Webull facing GOP scrutiny

NEW YORK POST

NOVEMBER 17, 2024

In the world of no-fee and low-fee brokers, Robinhood is the leader, but it’s facing increasingly stiff competition from an upstart known as Webull, founded by one of the top executives from Chinese-based e-commerce giant Alibaba.

And it’s Webull’s ties to China — seen increasingly as a US adversary — that could pose a major roadblock to the company’s ambitious plans for expansion, The Post has learned.

As The Post has reported, Congress has been demanding information about how US securities regulators are overseeing Webull’s safekeeping of customer data.

Now a group of attorneys general from red states have launched a probe into the company’s ties to the mainland and its ruling Chinese Communist Party, or CCP.

Webull’s ties to China could cause a major roadblock with expansion plans in the US. AFP via Getty Images

The incoming Trump administration, and the China skeptics he’s nominated in Marco Rubio as secretary of state, Matt Gaetz as AG and whoever gets the nod for Treasury, will likely turn up the heat even more, I am told.

People close to the matter say the interest from various government entities comes amid an apparent delay in Webull’s plans to list on the Nasdaq through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.

A spokesman for Webull and the firm’s outside counsel at Wilmer-Hale in DC didn’t return numerous emails and calls for comment.

The concerns echo some of the issues US regulators have with uberpopular China-owned short-video app TikTok — worries the CCP is siphoning user data for espionage purposes since the surveillance state there basically controls every company on its soil.

Both Republicans and Democrats have debated for years whether to ban TikTok, worried about the potential for identity theft, the CCP gleaning “biometric identifiers” and search history of its 170 million US [users.nypost.com](http://users.nypost.com)",wallstreetbets

In comparison, Rocketlab is just over $100M in revenue, but that is projected to grow to $600M next year.  In some ways it is difficult to create a value for Rocketlab based on the SpaceX value, but one thing is certain, based on the revenue number of SpaceX, the market is much larger from a revenue standpoint for Rocketlab than I certainly envisioned.  It is certainly plausible that Rocketlab will be able to climb to $2B - $3B in revenue in the next 5 years even if we tone down that growth rate.

1731788684.0,PENN - Anybody seeing this? Weekly crossed the 50-Day for first time in 3 years...,"The 8- and 21-day MA's just crossed over the 50-day on the weekly chart for the first time since 2021. This seems like a significant milestone for a stock that has been beaten down since it's failure with Barstool during the meme-stock craze.

You can see my other posts for a more in-depth thesis, but some recent news worth mentioning... plus a conspiracy theory:

* Stock is up 30% in the past 6 months, yet \~15% short interest of float.
* Q3 EPS beat, Rev didn't. Lower promo expenses. Lower losses in OSB than expected. Market share not where we want, but path to profitability is improving.
* Former Disney CTO joined the company. As a reminder, Disney owns ESPN so I see this as more buy-in from the Disney team.
* Greenlight Capital increased their stake, it is now their 6th largest holding. Einhorn said ""we believe the market ascribes a substantial negative value to \[their OSB business\]"". And thinks OSB could add $20 per share of value.
* ESPN --- ESPN Bet account linking allows the app to know your favorite sports and fantasy team so it can create personalized bets/marketing for users. Shows further integration with Disney.
* Finally launched in NYC, mixed results for now.
* Multiple analysts initiate coverage, showing it is a player worth tracking. Mixed opinions.

One big deal that no one talks about here is that Disney currently has $500M in warrants to purchase PENN stock. If I remember correctly, their agreement was for 3 years; if Disney doesn't like ESPN Bet's performance then they can pull the plug. Well we just crossed Year 1 and Disney's CTO has now joined PENN, they're linking ESPN accounts, they're seeing fewer losses than expected, and by 2026 (year 3) PENN believes they will have ""meaningful free cash flow"" from OSB. I have a very hard time believing that Disney would rather go through the headache of ripping out all of their integrations with PENN to find a new provider. Like the sunk cost there would be massive and why would they? The just want a faceless tech/casino provider so that they can put their own brand as the name. Fanduel/DraftKings/MGM, all of those would want their own names on the app.

Additionally, and maybe this really gets to the tinfoil hat (I don't think it's as crazy as you might), why wouldn't Disney acquire more PENN stock? It's one of the cheapest casino operators out there right now, sports betting is becoming more mainstream (and palatable for DIS investors), and they get more upside if this thing takes off? The market for OSB continues to grow as more states legalize it and they have a massive opportunity to gain market share. Why wouldn't they want more of that upside?

Look, I've been DCA-ing into PENN over the past year, so do I want this to be right? Absolutely. But there just seem to be way too many tailwinds popping up for this valuation to make any sense with even a remotely successful ESPN Bet. DraftKings has been significantly more unprofitable ever since launching their app in 2018 and trades at 5.0x their Rev, but when PENN is negative it trades at 0.5x (other valuation methods show similar)?

Yeah I don't see that lasting, so I'll buy more. Would love to hear your thoughts.",wallstreetbets

1731783716.0,~$500>$15k ,"3 months ago I put $500 into my account with the goal of seeing if I could take that and “make the small number bigger”. It’s not some massive million dollar gain or anything but I’m proud of it!

My rules were 

1. Try to double the money each of the first few plays
2. Once I had around $2k, don’t risk it all in one place
3. Make enough to actually create a long term position. 
4. Even if you lose, do not deposit any money into the account outside of “Invest with Rewards” from a Schwab American Express. 

I didn’t know much about options, and am still learning but I’ve lurked here a bit and have a few shares in AI & semiconductor companies in a Roth IRA that I’ve had for years (mainly TSM at around $50/share). Most of my gain has come from RKLB, TSM, and GRMN with the GRMN and TSM funding the RKLB calls that gave me the largest jump. 

My work schedule can be hectic and I needed something that I wouldn’t have to check for a few days if I was working during market hours so these fit the bill. I had tried the QQQ thing and sort of either lost or was neutral with it. My balls aren’t big enough for that yet. 

I have a lot to learn, but I’m thinking my best course of action is going to be to take the gains I’ve made, and use them to execute the remaining 8 RKLB calls I have to give myself a nice long term base.

Or I can go full regard, we’ll see!",wallstreetbets
1731783145.0,$BABA - The Azure of Asia-Pacific: Cloud Growth Could Send This Rocket to the Moon 🚀,"TL;DR

Alibaba ($BABA) is more than just an e-commerce behemoth; its cloud computing division, Alibaba Cloud, is leading the charge in Asia’s explosive cloud growth. With Asia’s cloud market expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.4% by 2028, this sleeping dragon might be your ticket to big gains. Let me break it down.



1. **Alibaba Cloud: The Azure of Asia-Pacific**

If Amazon has AWS and Microsoft has Azure, then Asia has Alibaba Cloud. It’s already the #1 cloud provider in Asia-Pacific, with close to 40% market share. The division isn’t just following Western models—it’s adapting to local markets and dominating. Countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are leveraging Alibaba Cloud as their backbone for digital transformation. **A key differentiator is that unlike Amazon and Microsoft, Alibaba has proprietary GenAI in QWEN that rivals OpenAIs GPT offerings.**

Recent milestones:

• +7% YoY growth in cloud revenue last quarter, and triple-digit growth in AI

• Launched Tongyi Qianwen, their ChatGPT competitor, tailored for enterprise solutions, giving them an AI edge. QWEN is ahead of GPT/OpenAI in several categories ([https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-claims-no-1-spot-in-ai-math-models-with-qwen2-math/))  ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html))

• Collaboration with ByteDance, NIO, and other Asian giants.

By aligning with governments and enterprises, **Alibaba Cloud is becoming indispensable in Asia’s growing digital economy.**



2. **Asia’s Cloud Market Is on Fire 🔥**

Asia-Pacific’s cloud market is expected to grow from $120 billion in 2023 to $264 billion by 2028 (CAGR: 17.4%; this is greater than the US market at \~12%). Alibaba’s dominance in the region positions it to capture a lion’s share of this pie. Here’s why this is huge:

• Cloud penetration is still low in Asia compared to the West. With increasing internet adoption, 5G expansion, and government incentives, the growth runway is long.

• Alibaba’s infrastructure covers 28 global regions and 90+ availability zones, but its home-field advantage in Asia gives it an edge Western competitors can’t match.



3. **The Cloud Is Becoming Alibaba’s Profit Engine**

E-commerce might have built Alibaba, but cloud computing will carry it into the future. This is exactly what happened with Amazon and AWS. Let’s connect the dots:

• AWS accounts for 70%+ of Amazon’s operating income.

Alibaba Cloud isn’t there yet, but it’s trending in the same direction. Margins are improving as it scales, and with increased AI adoption, demand for compute resources will only grow.

• China’s e-commerce regulation hit BABA hard, but cloud revenue is regulation-light and critical for economic growth. The Chinese government even promotes Alibaba’s cloud adoption for its national digital strategy and helps develop new contracts abroad ([https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar](https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-indonesia-sign-10bn-in-deals-on-evs-batteries-solar)).



4. **Dirt Cheap Valuation Compared to Western Cloud Giants**

BABA is severely undervalued compared to its US counterparts. Look at this:

|Metric|Alibaba ($BABA)|Microsoft ($MSFT)|Amazon ($AMZN)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/E|10x|34x|62x|
|Cloud Revenue CAGR|\~30% in Asia|\~20% globally|\~25% globally|

Why? China FUD. But if you believe in the secular growth trend of cloud computing in Asia, this valuation gap screams opportunity. Also, aside from Asia, Alibaba is constructing a new data center in Mexico ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba\_cloud\_mexico\_asia\_expansion/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/alibaba_cloud_mexico_asia_expansion/))



5. **The Macro Tailwinds Are Strong**

Let’s not ignore the China reopening play and China’s commitment to stimulate the economy. Add in Beijing’s recent pro-business rhetoric, and $BABA could see significant upside. Plus:

• Alibaba’s $25 billion buyback program means it’s returning value to shareholders at an aggressive pace.

• Spin-offs on the horizon: The cloud division could IPO in the future, unlocking massive shareholder value. Think AWS spin-off rumors but real. Let’s not forget that ANT 🐜 is back!! ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-backed-ant-profit-121522222.html)); ([https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3286177/ant-backed-credit-rating-firm-gets-central-bank-approval-china-after-3-year-wait))



6. **Price Targets and Risks**

• Base case: $150 in 12 months (30% upside).

• Bull case: $200+ if cloud growth accelerates (70%+ upside).

• Bear case: Regulatory crackdowns re-emerge, though unlikely given current trends. 



**Final Thoughts:**

Alibaba is a rare mix of value and growth with a transformative cloud business that’s only scratching the surface of its potential. The Asian cloud market is exploding, and BABA’s position as the “Azure of Asia” gives it an unbeatable edge. Don’t sleep on this one—when the market realizes the true potential of Alibaba Cloud, $BABA will soar.

One more thing, it’s chairman Joe Tsai is on a winning-streak. He invested $150M of his family fund into more shares of $BABA, and let’s not forget that the NY Liberty just won the WNBA title. The Brooklyn Nets aren’t there yet, but that doesn’t change that Joe Tsai is one very smart China bull! His strategic vision as chairman is up there with the top CEOs we look-up to today ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML\_Vo&t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znIj2ML_Vo&t=11s))



**P.S. for Key Concerns:**

1. Many of you Apes 🦍 fear Chinese investments because of regulatory concerns and the Republic overstepping. We saw what happened after Jack Ma criticized the financial infrastructure and compared it to a pawn shop. Over the years, China realized that they would benefit from leveraging Alibaba’s technology and have shifted their tone and relationship. Here is a recent article from Summer 2024 in China shared that Alibaba is in harmony with the republic ([https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Alibaba-s-3-year-antitrust-rectification-is-over-Beijing-says))

1. Another key China concern since the election are US tariffs moving to 60%. Aside from this being a negotiation tactic that will likely not come to fruition, international e-Commerce is growing for Alibaba and it is not attributed to the US (\~9% of Alibaba’s international ecommerce is attributed to the US). With news of the Chinese megaport in Peru, South America is going to become a huge importer of Chinese goods TAX-FREE [https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1](https://www.wsj.com/world/china-xi-jinping-latin-america-acf6dbc1)

1731743925.0,How Many Times a Day do You Check Your Investments?,"Every morning, the first thing I do—even before getting out of bed—is check my investment portfolio. It's almost automatic now, like brushing my teeth or pouring coffee. Except this habit doesn’t soothe me; it grips me with a strange combination of anticipation and dread.

I tell myself it’s just a quick check, just to stay informed, but it never is. The numbers on the screen dictate my mood for the day. A green arrow pointing up fills me with a fleeting sense of accomplishment, as if I’ve personally earned that little bump in my net worth. But when the numbers dip into the red, it feels like failure—irrational, I know, but there’s no separating the numbers from my emotions.

And it’s not just mornings. Lunchtime? I’m refreshing the app. Before bed? One last look. Even during conversations or work meetings, my mind drifts back to the portfolio, wondering if the market has shifted since the last time I checked.

I know it’s unhealthy. I know markets fluctuate and that long-term gains matter more than daily movements. I know I’m supposed to stay the course and trust the process. But knowing doesn’t stop the compulsive urge. It’s like I’m chasing some elusive control over a system I have no real power over.

The worst part? It doesn’t even feel productive. It’s not like I’m making significant changes each time I look. I’m just staring at the numbers, hoping they’ll align with my expectations, and when they don’t, I spiral into frustration or anxiety.

I wish I could let go. I wish I could look less, care less, and live more. But every time I resolve to step back, there’s always that ""what if"" tugging at me. What if today is the day something major happens and I miss it? What if I don’t act and regret it later?

It’s a constant battle between logic and compulsion, between trust and fear. And most days, the screen wins.

Easy f***ing money, right?” So I sell 7 measly naked calls on $SMCI, thinking, “What’s the worst that could happen?”

Well, spoiler alert: this is the worst that could happen.

It’s the $34.5 strike, expiring this week. Why $34.5? No reason, honestly. The number looked funny, like something a Redditor would bet on after three beers. I figure SMCI’s not getting delisted, but the stock’s been flopping around like a dead fish, and I’m thinking, “This isn’t going anywhere. Collect a few bucks in premium, call it a day.”

So fast forward to today. I’m scrolling Twitter, and the market looks like it’s about to gap up harder than my stress levels. SMCI’s pre-market action? Straight Viagra. The thing’s rocketing toward $34.5, and I’m sitting here sweating like I’m in a sauna wrapped in saran wrap. If this thing breaches my strike, I’m f***ed six ways to Sunday. My phone’s blowing up with margin warnings, and I’m Googling “how to fake your own death to escape brokerage debt.”

Like, what if it’s him? What if this dude is sitting there licking his chops while I get bent over by the market?

So yeah, I’m officially bracing for impact. Margin call inbound, financial dignity gone, and I’ll probably have to Uber Eats him a steak dinner as an apology for existing. Anyone got a time machine? Or at least a good excuse to tell my broker why I can’t pay?

I’m glad to say that just about 2 weeks later I’M BACK TO $10K!!!!!

How did I do it? I looked back at my strategies and figured out what was working vs. what went wrong and decided to revert to my original strategy and it worked! My girlfriend is no longer giving me the side eye!

The play : arbitrage plays give you the best odds in the stock market. Completely binary!! If the judges say yes? Albertsons runs to 34 they say no it probably crashes to $11.

Earlier stock market declines were driven by Ukraine's first U.S. missile launch into Russia and President Vladimir Putin's approval of an updated nuclear strategy

For Gaurav Mallik of Pallas Capital Advisors, geopolitical uncertainty did contribute to the volatility. As for Nvidia's results, he expects them to be strong, citing capital spending by big tech companies and what he sees as ‘no obvious alternatives’ to the company's chips

1732048483.0,Let it $SNOW,"Let's face it, $SNOW has been one of the most disappointing-performing stocks of the year. While $NVDA is riding the AI wave, and $MSTR is riding the BTC boom, $SNOW has been sitting here like a fat child eating cake and shitting himself in the process.

But this is all about to change, and let's discuss why:

1. Winter is coming, and people will associate $SNOW with warm fuzzy feelings while drinking hot cocoa by the fireplace. This is inherently bullish.
2. $SNOW has historically always beaten revenue estimates (bullish), and 88% of the time it beats EPS estimates. I expect this time to be no different (beat both revenue and EPS), however this is never enough to rally this stock (more below).
3. $SNOW has been hiring like crazy. I know because I've applied twice so far and been rejected both times (smart choice on their part - bullish), which means they're being picky and likely receiving a lot of strong candidates to improve their offering (extra bullish). I've been keeping an eye on all open positions, along with how long they're open for, and new ones that pop up. Everything I've seen indicates a hiring frenzy to expand into more markets, take on new clients, etc.
4. $SNOW tends to retain their customers and strengthen existing relationships. Just today they announced a stronger partnership with $MSFT by releasing a new platform to work with $MSFT Power Platform (bullish AF)
5. In May, $SNOW appointed Sridhar Ramaswamy as the new CEO, who is expected to focus on enhancing the company's AI (bullish) product strategy.
6. Going off the point above, the actual real-world numbers of customers using their AI product is genuinely exploding, and we all know how bullish AI is in today's market. 

**Q**: Ok, but why is THIS time different than all the other earnings reports when $SNOW crashed and burned?

**A**: Like I said in Point 2 above, we Snowflakians always beat revenue and EPS predictions, but for some reason the stock always goes down. The reason behind this - as is the consensus of analysts - is that investors are cautious against how much money $SNOW is pouring into their products, R&D, and operating costs. This quarter we should start to actually see the results of these investments, returning strong usage statistics and a healthy increase in overall adoption from the industry.

**Q**: Ok, but what about, like, Databricks and stuff?

**A**: Databricks can suck my nuts (they also haven't hired me yet - I'm trying to get in before they go public for those sweet stock gainz)

**My Positions** (Screenshot below):

1732045774.0,$VRT ➡️ S&P 500: Coming Soon,"Vertiv ($VRT) has been ripping all year and is up 190% YTD fueled by continuous AI & data center demand.  I think it has a high likelihood of being **added to the S&P 500 during the Q4 rebalancing** which will be announced Dec 6th. I'll share a brief overview of $VRT and then my thinking behind the S&P 500 inclusion.

*Position*: $VRT shares, 2025 & 2026 leaps  
*Disclaimer*: not financial advice, do your own research  
*Other analysts if you don't trust random redditors:*

# Company Analysis

**High level company overview:**  
[Vertiv Holdings Co.](https://www.vertiv.com/en-us/) *engages in the design, manufacture, and service of critical digital infrastructure technology that powers, cools, deploys, secures and maintains electronics that process, store and transmit data. It also offers power management products, thermal management products, integrated rack systems, modular solutions, and management systems for monitoring and controlling digital infrastructure.* 

**Leadership team:**

[Mr. Albertazzi?? absolute stud + italian](https://preview.redd.it/gluw4pmapw1e1.png?width=2552&format=png&auto=webp&s=9514eeb811f9d6fe57a756932c46dc81c9548d82)

**Financial Overview**:  
Strong financials across the board and continue to raise guidance. 2024 guidance confirmed, data is here:

Net Sales: $7,805M, organic up 14%  
Adj. Operating Profit: $1,485M  
Adj. Operating Margin: 19.0%, up 370 bps  
Adj. Free Cash Flow: $1,000M

Another overall view from today's investor day presentation, the full deck can be found here: [Nov 18 - Investor Day](https://s23.q4cdn.com/959471387/files/doc_presentations/Vertiv-2024-Investor-Event-Presentation.pdf).

[Balance Sheet Metrics](https://preview.redd.it/ed3ayuigow1e1.png?width=2552&format=png&auto=webp&s=8471b4d6ccead1f63e7929882fe38b85ed9930f1)

Fundamentally I think they have some **key advantages** that will allow for them to continue to dominate the market:

(1) AI-Demand & Margin Expansion: Multiple levers for continued further expansion of adjusted operating margin to \~25% in 2029 (Slide 14 & 36)  
(2) Product Leadership: Vertiv services provide unmatched critical digital infrastructure support (Slide 26-28)  
(3) Flexible Capital: $12.5B of capital deployment through 2029. Up from $6.5B at Nov 2023 Investor Day (Slide 48)  
(4) Energy Demand: Power and cooling capabilities are already crucial today, as energy demand surges, efficiency and cost will become a major factor

**Risks**  
\- AI Bubble: tbh I'm not a believer in this narrative but its something to consider since their sales are driven by AI related companies  
\- $NVDA: $VRT trades with $NVDA (so does the market in a way) but if you pull up the charts there is high correlation. Also $NVDA ER is tomorrow  
\- Valuation: They trade at a 81.86 PE ratio 

# S&P 500 Inclusion

The S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs 4x/year with the next one coming up. [SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en) announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed.

S&P rebalancing presents an opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is potential for a \~5-10% price increase. In short, the rebalance forces institutions who follow certain indexes to buy the stock as it is now in the index & generally there is a positive impact on company's reputation.

Although the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here: [SP 500 Criteria](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf), there is a bit of thematic flexibility. By definition the index is ""a market cap-weighted index of US large- and mid-cap stocks."" Typically companies need to be $18B or larger in market cap and historically profitable. Negative trailing EPS, high volatility, recent IPO, etc. may restrict a stock from eligibility.

Below is the **SP 500 index sector weighting** (as of Nov 14):  
Technology: 33.32% | Financial Services: 13.19% | Consumer Cyclical: 10.80% |. Healthcare: 10.54% | Communication Services: 9.03% | Industrials: 7.58% | Consumer Defensive: 5.56% | Energy: 3.44% | Utilities: 2.54% | Real Estate: 2.17% | Basic Materials: 1.83%

**Why Vertiv ($VRT)?**

* Thematic fit: the index is focused on representing the best small/mid cap companies in the US and $VRT fits the industrial/energy category (the industry will get more love under the new administration), it fits the innovation/technology aspect, and of course the energy/AI theme 
* Solid earnings and growth: self-explanatory in the company financial analysis above
* Strong momentum: this is important and imho, an underrated factor. A great example of this is Palantir ($PLTR) which btw pumped like 10% off of the news. Now I know r/wallstreetbets has a love/hate relationship with $PLTR but put that aside for now (it was added to the index around $35)

**Rebalance Timeline**: [Q4 2024 ](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/ICE_NYSE_2024_Yearly_Trading_Calendar.pdf)  
\*based on the usual schedule, check the website for official announcements

* Quarter End Date: Dec 31
* Announcement Date: Early December (typically 1st week)
* Rebalance Date: Dec 20 (typically 3rd Friday)

# Closing Note

I will be waiting until after NVIDIA reports earnings on 11/20 to make any adjustments to this trade or to rethink my thesis. Would recommend this especially if you do not already have a position in $VRT.

They have invested in and improved their mobile app massively. By showing bolder download prompts the result is +3M incremental app downloads. They reduced by 33% impressions of looking back (previous purchases) changed to looking for something new (inspiration and idea’s). Their app now feels and looks like a big Pinterest inspiration board with endless handmade and hand designed items.

***Etsy will repurchase up to an additional $1 billion of their common stock.***

They have spend the last Q3 on improving the search. Before the search results would be full of Aliexpress crap for about most of the feed. I’ve done research and searched on many niche and generic search terms. Most of the results were handmade and hand designed items. They have a \~40% reduction in search results where >25% of listings look a like.

I downloaded the app for my DD but i was scrolling for hours because it had good recommendations and inspiration for handmade items. It felt like using Pinterest before it got ridden with ads. Like browsing Tumblr before it got ruined.

Focus on gift giving gift recommendations per occasion and who you are shopping for. Investments into app development, marketing, expansion in the breath + sophistication of their data and integration of AI and GenAI.

**Position:** 52 shares in ETSY.  
**Next earnings:** 19 feb 2025.  
**Opinion:** Buy and hold, gift buying season is now, i expect next earnings to be good, buy shares for cheap.

These are very reasonable assessments, if you make your prognosis on the base of efficient market behaviour.

So why would some rando - yours truly - troll these halls of wisdom with a random theory of what is going to happen? The answer is simple: That is what we do on WSB. Also, I have bullet points:

  
1st: The efficient market is dead. After the election massive amounts of retail investors have swept into the stock market and cryptocurrencies. According to [some video I saw on the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P03PfYgNjmw&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW&index=20) when large amounts of retail investors get into the market, the ""efficiency"" suffers, meaning, the market does not find the right prices for equities and beins to overprice them.

  
2nd. According to [another video on the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5PF2PcElV0&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW&index=19) (just coincidentally from the same ""youtuber"") the human brain is evolutionary not equipped, to stop greeding after more profit, once it started seeing progress. This is true for professional investors and even much more so for significantly less sophisticated individuals without the saftey net of a risk desk. This means the people, who stream into the stock market and cryptocurrencies right now, will not stop driving the prices up.

  
3rd. I´ve done my own research (watching those videos on the internet) and it says, that only two options stop us in those tracks: Learning through losses to take less risk and price more realistically or going broke. I find ""my research"" heavily supported in this subreddit.

  
4th. Market efficiency will further erode by currently unpredictable effects of an unknown, but likely rather disrupting policy. This will cause for some investors the pain, necessary to adapt or leave the market, for others it will cause massive gains, which will draw even more less sophistcated traders in.

  
5th. Given the limited sophistication, these investors are likely to focus on a limited range of assets, which are well represented in the media: AI and cryptocurrencies. This will lead to a continuing strong and overperforming bull run, drawing other investments up in it´s wake, but only on a limited scale.

  
6th. Companies will use this opportunity to launch extremely well doing IPOs.

  
7th. This bull run will end in a crash, because - according to my research on the internet and a couple of decades watching the hoax establishment news - it always does. Keep in mind, that this event does not necessarily have to happen in 2025.

  
8th. That market crash will wipe out massive amounts of wealth, ruin existences and make other filthy, filthy rich. Usually the latter are those, who were already filthy, filthy rich before. Unsophisticated investors will leave the market or be forced to leave and the markets become significantly more efficient again.

  
7th. Doing my own research means, I have to put foward conclusions. I weighed mine at least for several minutes while writing this text, so they are highly reliable predictions, but I still warn anybody from mistaking them for financial advice or antyhing else than demigodly prohecies:

  
\- The crash of the stock market will not lead to an extinction event, but a selection event. While companies will get wiped out, those, which survive will dominate the stock market just like the mag7 now, which are basically the survivors of the dotcom crash.

  
\- The crash of the cryptocurrency market will lead to an extinction event. It will wipe out most of cypto investors and funds/ETFs. This is due to the simple fact, that the market is way to much of a single economic niche. After that it may recover up to a point.

  
tl;dr: The efficient market is dead - long live the goldrush.",wallstreetbets

1731997145.0,Some thought from first year stock investment,"This month marks roughly the first year of my serious financial investment. The returning is satisfying.

I’d like to share some thought.

**My label**

1.Long-term investing on the product of market

[2.You](http://2.You) an Never Make Money Beyond Your Cognitive Abilities

**Important material I’ve read**

1.Youtube: How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio

2.The Little Book of Common Sense Investing

3.Psycology of money

**Thought**

Part of my money is on sp500 related. Besides this, I still did some stock picking, which is I really want to share.

1.Nvdia:Never sold out, keep buying

Three reasons: 

a.I deeply believe productivity gain is the most powerful drive for economy growth(read it from How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio). 

b.GenAI dramatically improves productivity.

c.Nvidia is the cornerstone of the GenAI

2.PAN:Hold 

I bought some last Dec. In March, the CEO announced the strategy change of the company, the stock dropped by 30%。This does not affect me at all since I am in this industry and their strategy is not bad.

Now the price came back even higher.

3.Tesla: Bought below 200 and then sold out after “We robot” event. I was disappointed on the bland event

We all know what is going on now. LOL

4.Crowdstrike:

Sold out after outage.

**I really don’t understand it.. How come the stock price of company with this huge mistake still came back. The customers still believe in the reliability of the company product? or other competitors are so behind?**

This black swan event can dramatically affect my cognization.

5.Palantir

Seriously considered and decided not buy. Now it is 6x.

6.Micron, Dell, qualcomm

Mediumlconsidered and decided not buying it.

Since I watch news everyday, I noticed some good quarterly report and  stock gain. so want to jump in.

I don’t feel strong confidence, the drive is from its recent performance and their AI-related product, but I still feel doubt of them and don’t have strong internal acknowledge of the products.

===

This year really get me deeper understanding of my own mindset and the market

Big lessons:

When you don’t have rational confidence of a company, you are much emotionally affected by single event and the market. 

Business acumen: should’ve seriously considered Tesla before election. 

Biggest Mistake:

I still got tricked into making more transaction due to make more money mindset.",wallstreetbets

1731982227.0,I think my friend sold me my calls on $SMCI,"I swear on my mother’s eyes. I’m sitting there like a fing genius looking at my hood gambling account, staring at the SMCI chart and reading all this bullshit regards are spewing on twitter about the stock getting delisted. Luckly, I just came out of a similar trade on B.Riley and kinda figured if those frauds can get away with not filing financials on time for over 180 days and they are still trading, there is no way SMCI will get delisted.

I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a \~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5. Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh

Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business. My phone buzzes, and it’s my buddy. This guy texts me out of nowhere, “Man, I think I’m fucked. I sold $34.5 naked calls on SMCI this week. Thought it’d be easy money.”

So I’m like, waiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.. I check my broker app and look at the open interest on these contracts, and my jaw hits the goddamn floor. The open interest is 257. lol. **257 contracts**, and your boy here owns **250** of them. I’m the goddamn other side of his trade! I'm the guy that said yuuuuuuuuuup I'll take those off your hands sir. 

If everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f\*\*\*ing check for $62,000 (so far).

He knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know **how many** or **what strike**. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money.

Now I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy.

So that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do? Do I come clean, or let him find out the hard way? Either way, I’m buying a steak dinner tomorrow. Maybe I’ll even let him smell it. Also a hooker.",wallstreetbets

1731978751.0,SMCI sucks and you're a sucker for buying it ,"The way it's run is halarious, it's essentially a couple brothers robbing the investors. They buy property to rent to SMCI for over market value. The CEO then circulates parts around shell companies owned by his brothers to then sell back to SMCI for more, successfully scalping money from the company into their private companies. To boost stock price, they recognize revenue on sales that are not yet completed by faking deliveries. Now their top clients are ditching them for others, and they have no moat. In fact their services suck. There's literally 0 reason to invest in this company that is heading for the ground 


Also, a very important detail: Charles (CEO of SMCI) has been bff with Jensen Huang for a long time. This is why this uncompetitive company has been given almost exclusive supplier status for Nividia. After the scandal, Jensen is pulling orders away to save Nividia from backlash. There's no growth story here. It's a guy giving his buddy an allowance and will remain that way for the foreseeable future.

80 87.5C 8/15/2025 @ 6.58 avg (~52k)

DD:

TLDR; Walmart is poised to easily gain +20-30% over the next year. In conjunction with incredibly cheap LEAPs (20% IV) this means the potential for two caniac combos worth of tendies. 

The Overview 
Walmart has seen almost a 30% gain since last earnings as investors are piling in on the presumption that increased automation and E-Commerce will improve top and bottom lines. What is less talked about right now is the effect the Trump administration will have on Walmart and its domestic competitors. Walmart sources almost 2/3s of its products domestically in the US. In fact, Walmart has direct relationships with US suppliers and manufacturers— this has been a core part of their business model in limiting costs (and food prices, as we will get to). Walmarts competitors, however, mostly source abroad: Target for example has almost 49% of its supplying factories based in China alone. Yea, that’s right— the same China Trump wants to slap massive import tariffs on. So what happens when Walmarts competitors raise prices? Well, there’s a couple options (all of which are either favorable or neutral to Walmart). Either A) Competitors raise prices; Walmart does not on its domestic products and they subsequently capture a much larger market share as consumers flock to cheap Walmart name brand goods (tendies) B) Competitors raise prices and Walmart uses it as an excuse to raise prices as well; profit margins go up while market share stays approximately the same (tendies) or C) this analysis is wrong and Walmart is hit just as hard as its competitors; the automation, E-Commerce platforms, and foreign markets Walmart is attempting to get market share in (and the market is obsessed with) continue to bear fruit, and we are left either up or approximately the same (kids meal tendies). This is in conjunction with the fact that Walmart has reported that consumers from all income strata have already begun switching to Walmart items from competitor’s stores (read, brand loyalty is in the gutter) making any price discrepancies between Walmart and its competitors have a magnified effect on consumer demand. 

Execution:
But why the hell would I yolo in Walmart which might only go up 20-30% if you are right instead of other, juicier stocks that could move more? It’s because the relative stability of Walmart’s stock over the past several years works massively in our favor. 7 month ATM LEAPS are priced with 20% IV in mind (+10% break even), or roughly 6.50 per option. You regards spend more time value premium on a Tesla monthly call than a year long Walmart one. This means we can eliminate much of the risk of this DD (timing the market) and exaggerate the gains from that “small” 20-30% move. We are talking a 3-4x of your investment from a -mostly- theta safe investment. And remember, that’s from at the money LEAPS. This is what makes this investment choice such a juicy opportunity for us.",wallstreetbets

1731961482.0,betting big on jnpr: waiting for doj’s green light on hpe’s $40/share offer,"alright, degenerates, here’s the breakdown. hewlett packard enterprise (hpe) is set to acquire juniper networks (jnpr) for $14 billion, offering $40 per share, which is a solid premium over where jnpr is trading now. the deal has already cleared the uk’s competition and markets authority (cma), and we’re just waiting on the u.s. department of justice (doj) for the final decision. since the european commission has already approved, there’s some optimism that the doj will follow suit, but nothing is ever guaranteed.

why does this matter? well, if the doj gives the green light, jnpr shareholders get a nice payout at $40 per share. this move also strengthens hpe’s ai-driven networking capabilities, setting them up to compete harder against cisco and other big players in the market.

but let’s talk about risks. the doj could still throw a wrench into this deal if they have antitrust concerns, and if that happens, jnpr’s stock could take a serious hit. there’s a lot riding on regulatory approval, and if the market senses any delay or trouble, the premium baked into the stock price could disappear fast.

so, what’s the play? one option is buying jnpr calls with strike prices below $40, expiring after the doj’s expected decision. this could pay off big if everything goes smoothly. alternatively, you could just buy shares and hold, hoping for the $40 payout. just remember, if the deal falls apart, you’re exposed to the downside.

1731959902.0,How RFK Jr. Could Make $HIMS Great Again,"**TL;DR:** Investors are pulling back from pharmaceutical stocks as RFK Jr. has been appointed to lead HHS, creating an opportunity for $HIMS stock while it is still undervalued. If RFK pushes to block Medicare/Medicaid coverage of costly anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound, people could turn to more affordable alternatives like $HIMS. In 2022, Medicare alone spent over $4.6 billion on Ozempic, and that number likely ballooned in 2023/2024. As RFK targets big pharma, affordable GLP-1 drugs from $HIMS and similar platforms could become the go-to option.

**Pharma Pullback**

Criticisms of the pharmaceutical industry by RFK Jr. have led to uncertainty in big pharma, resulting in a sell-off. This sell-off has indirectly affected companies like $HIMS, as some investors are unsure of his stance on anti-obesity drugs. Understanding RFK’s viewpoint on these drugs can help us strategize for potential market opportunities.

**GLP-1 Reliance**

After individuals have been using GLP-1 medications for some time, they may need to continue the treatment long-term to maintain its benefits. This ongoing requirement creates a strong and sustained business opportunity surrounding these drugs.

GLP-1 receptor agonists, like semaglutide (Ozempic) and tirzepatide, are widely used for weight loss. According to Martin Whyte, an associate professor of metabolic medicine, these drugs provide doses far greater than the body naturally produces, suppressing the body’s ability to produce GLP-1 on its own. This can lead to increased hunger when people stop taking the medication, making weight regain almost inevitable.

A study published in the **Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)** found that placebo users gained 7% of their weight back compared to those who continued taking GLP-1 drugs, who saw an average weight loss of -7.9%. If Medicare/Medicaid stops covering these drugs, patients will either regain weight or seek affordable alternatives like $HIMS, which offers GLP-1 treatments for $200 per month, compared to the $1,300 a month of the name brand

**RFK's Stance on Obesity Drugs**

RFK doesn’t oppose obesity drugs themselves but believes that the core problem of obesity lies in the poor quality of food in the U.S. He has criticized pharmaceutical giants like Novo Nordisk for their focus on selling to Americans while ignoring the underlying health crisis.

RFK has pointed out that the massive spending on drugs like Ozempic could be better spent on improving food systems and promoting healthier lifestyles. He critiques that while Novo Nordisk profits from Ozempic sales in the U.S.,  its home country focuses on diet and exercise as obesity solutions. His criticism aligns with an agenda to move away from pharmaceutical dependency as solution to obesity.

**Why This Matters for $HIMS**

Medicare spent more than $4.6 billion on Ozempic in 2022, and the widespread adoption of these GLP-1 drugs likely pushed that figure higher in 2024. The FDA approval of drugs like Wegovy as anti-obesity treatments has most likely ballooned spending.

The following chart illustrates the rapid increase in sales of GLP-1-based anti-obesity medications over the recent year. Wegovy and Zepbound sales have skyrocketed, reflecting the strong demand for weight-loss treatments.

[Sales of Brand Name GLP-1 Anti Obesity Medication \(Congressional Budget Office\)](https://preview.redd.it/gh5i5co8qp1e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=aac413829cb8fb15afb8851d3ec0b880810e4e9a)

If RFK succeeds in restricting Medicare/Medicaid coverage for these expensive weight-loss drugs, people will look for more affordable solutions. This opens an opportunity for $HIMS, which offers GLP-1 drugs at a much lower cost via its platform. As mainstream options become restricted, $HIMS could see a significant boost in demand.

* [CNBC Coverage](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/medicare-can-cover-weight-loss-drugs-if-used-for-added-health-benefit.html)

While there are many possible scenarios, my research suggests that this is a path forward. With RFK’s push to limit big pharma influence, $HIMS may emerge as a key player in the affordable weight management space.

I’m sitting there yesterday, feeling like a market god, thinking, “You know what? I’m gonna sling some naked calls. Easy f***ing money, right?” So I sell 7 measly naked calls on $SMCI, thinking, “What’s the worst that could happen?”

Well, spoiler alert: this is the worst that could happen.

It’s the $34.5 strike, expiring this week. Why $34.5? No reason, honestly. The number looked funny, like something a Redditor would bet on after three beers. I figure SMCI’s not getting delisted, but the stock’s been flopping around like a dead fish, and I’m thinking, “This isn’t going anywhere. Collect a few bucks in premium, call it a day.”

So fast forward to today. I’m scrolling Twitter, and the market looks like it’s about to gap up harder than my stress levels. SMCI’s pre-market action? Straight Viagra. The thing’s rocketing toward $34.5, and I’m sitting here sweating like I’m in a sauna wrapped in saran wrap. If this thing breaches my strike, I’m f***ed six ways to Sunday. My phone’s blowing up with margin warnings, and I’m Googling “how to fake your own death to escape brokerage debt.”

Here’s the kicker: my buddy casually mentioned he’s in on SMCI this week, but he didn’t say how. Calls? Puts? Shares? No idea. And now I’m paranoid. What if he’s on the other side of this trade? Like, what if it’s him? What if this dude is sitting there licking his chops while I get bent over by the market?

So yeah, I’m officially bracing for impact. Margin call inbound, financial dignity gone, and I’ll probably have to Uber Eats him a steak dinner as an apology for existing. Anyone got a time machine? Or at least a good excuse to tell my broker why I can’t pay?

I tried posting this earlier but got removed for post being too short so here I am again

A couple weeks ago [I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ghf3gq/shakeschangecup/) of how I had started trading in July of this year with $10k.

In about 90 days I was able to get up to $15k and I cashed out my earnings bringing me back to $10k.

At this same time I discovered options \*cue people screaming and jumping out fire escapes\*. I failed miserabley losing 75% of my portfolio in a week. I know, I know.

I didn’t give up. Nov 4 I was just barely above $2k and I told myself I’d climb out the hole no matter what.

I’m glad to say that just about 2 weeks later I’M BACK TO $10K!!!!!

How did I do it? I looked back at my strategies and figured out what was working vs. what went wrong and decided to revert to my original strategy and it worked! My girlfriend is no longer giving me the side eye!

Big shout outs to Blackrock (again, I know), MSTR, and TSLA among many others for getting me back to my starting point.

What I learned? believe in yourself first and foremost, and don’t give up

CarMax has been facing its own challenges, including reduced vehicle purchases, lower offers to consumers due to declining used car values, and rising repossessions. I believe puts on CarMax might be a winning strategy.

Which other car dealerships may be worth targeting the dip?

1732057508.0,LOTTO PLAY : Kroger/Albertsons buyout will go through!!,"M/A activity has been down substantially for “reasons”. But for different “reasons” Wall Street expect M/A to rebound, MASSIVELY.

My bet is the M/A season starts off with a BANG!! Kroger is buying Albertsons for $34 a share. 

Kroger has bent over backwards to accommodate all the request of various agencies and states. 

And objectively if they don’t merge they simply can’t compete on price. 

Important dates : just one Dec 10th 1/3 judges will make their decision public. The other 2 judges mentioned they would make decisions “quickly”. ( keep in mind this deal was announced Oct 2022)



The play : arbitrage plays give you the best odds in the stock market. Completely binary!! If the judges say yes? Albertsons runs to 34 they say no it probably crashes to $11.

Puts are expensive AF right now, but OTM calls are dirt cheap. So cheap anyone can play!!!

$0.08 for $27 calls expiring Jan 2025 is my play, Why the hell not? The options market seems to think this is a done deal. 

TLDR : OTM calls are so cheap even you can afford it.

1732056879.0,Stocks shrug off war worries ahead of NVIDIA results?,"Stocks are rallying, with shares of NVIDIA Corp. rising ahead of earnings. Bitcoin extended its post-election rally

Options trading suggests that NVIDIA's earnings announcement on Wednesday will be the most important catalyst of the year - even more important than the Federal Reserve's December meeting, Barclays strategists said. Shares of the chipmaker, which is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom, rose 4.9 per cent, leading the Standard & Poor's 500 Index higher. Earlier stock market declines were driven by Ukraine's first U.S. missile launch into Russia and President Vladimir Putin's approval of an updated nuclear strategy

For Gaurav Mallik of Pallas Capital Advisors, geopolitical uncertainty did contribute to the volatility. As for Nvidia's results, he expects them to be strong, citing capital spending by big tech companies and what he sees as ‘no obvious alternatives’ to the company's chips

1732048483.0,Let it $SNOW,"Let's face it, $SNOW has been one of the most disappointing-performing stocks of the year. While $NVDA is riding the AI wave, and $MSTR is riding the BTC boom, $SNOW has been sitting here like a fat child eating cake and shitting himself in the process.

But this is all about to change, and let's discuss why:

1. Winter is coming, and people will associate $SNOW with warm fuzzy feelings while drinking hot cocoa by the fireplace. This is inherently bullish.
2. $SNOW has historically always beaten revenue estimates (bullish), and 88% of the time it beats EPS estimates. I expect this time to be no different (beat both revenue and EPS), however this is never enough to rally this stock (more below).
3. $SNOW has been hiring like crazy. I know because I've applied twice so far and been rejected both times (smart choice on their part - bullish), which means they're being picky and likely receiving a lot of strong candidates to improve their offering (extra bullish). I've been keeping an eye on all open positions, along with how long they're open for, and new ones that pop up. Everything I've seen indicates a hiring frenzy to expand into more markets, take on new clients, etc.
4. $SNOW tends to retain their customers and strengthen existing relationships. Just today they announced a stronger partnership with $MSFT by releasing a new platform to work with $MSFT Power Platform (bullish AF)
5. In May, $SNOW appointed Sridhar Ramaswamy as the new CEO, who is expected to focus on enhancing the company's AI (bullish) product strategy.
6. Going off the point above, the actual real-world numbers of customers using their AI product is genuinely exploding, and we all know how bullish AI is in today's market. 

**Q**: Ok, but why is THIS time different than all the other earnings reports when $SNOW crashed and burned?

**A**: Like I said in Point 2 above, we Snowflakians always beat revenue and EPS predictions, but for some reason the stock always goes down. The reason behind this - as is the consensus of analysts - is that investors are cautious against how much money $SNOW is pouring into their products, R&D, and operating costs. This quarter we should start to actually see the results of these investments, returning strong usage statistics and a healthy increase in overall adoption from the industry.

**Q**: Ok, but what about, like, Databricks and stuff?

**A**: Databricks can suck my nuts (they also haven't hired me yet - I'm trying to get in before they go public for those sweet stock gainz)

**My Positions** (Screenshot below):

1732045774.0,$VRT ➡️ S&P 500: Coming Soon,"Vertiv ($VRT) has been ripping all year and is up 190% YTD fueled by continuous AI & data center demand.  I think it has a high likelihood of being **added to the S&P 500 during the Q4 rebalancing** which will be announced Dec 6th. I'll share a brief overview of $VRT and then my thinking behind the S&P 500 inclusion.

*Position*: $VRT shares, 2025 & 2026 leaps  
*Disclaimer*: not financial advice, do your own research  
*Other analysts if you don't trust random redditors:*   
\- RadnorCapital on X  
\- Institutional analysts: [NASDAQ $VRT](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vrt/analyst-research)

# Company Analysis

**High level company overview:**  
[Vertiv Holdings Co.](https://www.vertiv.com/en-us/) *engages in the design, manufacture, and service of critical digital infrastructure technology that powers, cools, deploys, secures and maintains electronics that process, store and transmit data. It also offers power management products, thermal management products, integrated rack systems, modular solutions, and management systems for monitoring and controlling digital infrastructure.* 

**Leadership team:**

[Mr. Albertazzi?? absolute stud + italian](https://preview.redd.it/gluw4pmapw1e1.png?width=2552&format=png&auto=webp&s=9514eeb811f9d6fe57a756932c46dc81c9548d82)

**Financial Overview**:  
Strong financials across the board and continue to raise guidance. 2024 guidance confirmed, data is here:

Net Sales: $7,805M, organic up 14%  
Adj. Operating Profit: $1,485M  
Adj. Operating Margin: 19.0%, up 370 bps  
Adj. Free Cash Flow: $1,000M

Another overall view from today's investor day presentation, the full deck can be found here: [Nov 18 - Investor Day](https://s23.q4cdn.com/959471387/files/doc_presentations/Vertiv-2024-Investor-Event-Presentation.pdf).

[Balance Sheet Metrics](https://preview.redd.it/ed3ayuigow1e1.png?width=2552&format=png&auto=webp&s=8471b4d6ccead1f63e7929882fe38b85ed9930f1)

Fundamentally I think they have some **key advantages** that will allow for them to continue to dominate the market:

(1) AI-Demand & Margin Expansion: Multiple levers for continued further expansion of adjusted operating margin to \~25% in 2029 (Slide 14 & 36)  
(2) Product Leadership: Vertiv services provide unmatched critical digital infrastructure support (Slide 26-28)  
(3) Flexible Capital: $12.5B of capital deployment through 2029. Up from $6.5B at Nov 2023 Investor Day (Slide 48)  
(4) Energy Demand: Power and cooling capabilities are already crucial today, as energy demand surges, efficiency and cost will become a major factor

**Risks**  
\- AI Bubble: tbh I'm not a believer in this narrative but its something to consider since their sales are driven by AI related companies  
\- $NVDA: $VRT trades with $NVDA (so does the market in a way) but if you pull up the charts there is high correlation. Also $NVDA ER is tomorrow  
\- Valuation: They trade at a 81.86 PE ratio 

# S&P 500 Inclusion

The S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs 4x/year with the next one coming up. [SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en) announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed.

S&P rebalancing presents an opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is potential for a \~5-10% price increase. In short, the rebalance forces institutions who follow certain indexes to buy the stock as it is now in the index & generally there is a positive impact on company's reputation.

Although the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here: [SP 500 Criteria](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf), there is a bit of thematic flexibility. By definition the index is ""a market cap-weighted index of US large- and mid-cap stocks."" Typically companies need to be $18B or larger in market cap and historically profitable. Negative trailing EPS, high volatility, recent IPO, etc. may restrict a stock from eligibility.

Below is the **SP 500 index sector weighting** (as of Nov 14):  
Technology: 33.32% | Financial Services: 13.19% | Consumer Cyclical: 10.80% |. Healthcare: 10.54% | Communication Services: 9.03% | Industrials: 7.58% | Consumer Defensive: 5.56% | Energy: 3.44% | Utilities: 2.54% | Real Estate: 2.17% | Basic Materials: 1.83%

**Why Vertiv ($VRT)?**

* Thematic fit: the index is focused on representing the best small/mid cap companies in the US and $VRT fits the industrial/energy category (the industry will get more love under the new administration), it fits the innovation/technology aspect, and of course the energy/AI theme 
* Solid earnings and growth: self-explanatory in the company financial analysis above
* Strong momentum: this is important and imho, an underrated factor. A great example of this is Palantir ($PLTR) which btw pumped like 10% off of the news. Now I know r/wallstreetbets has a love/hate relationship with $PLTR but put that aside for now (it was added to the index around $35)

**Rebalance Timeline**: [Q4 2024 ](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/ICE_NYSE_2024_Yearly_Trading_Calendar.pdf)  
\*based on the usual schedule, check the website for official announcements

* Quarter End Date: Dec 31
* Announcement Date: Early December (typically 1st week)
* Rebalance Date: Dec 20 (typically 3rd Friday)

# Closing Note

I will be waiting until after NVIDIA reports earnings on 11/20 to make any adjustments to this trade or to rethink my thesis. Would recommend this especially if you do not already have a position in $VRT.

Their app now feels and looks like a big Pinterest inspiration board with endless handmade and hand designed items.

***Etsy will repurchase up to an additional $1 billion of their common stock.***

They have spend the last Q3 on improving the search. Before the search results would be full of Aliexpress crap for about most of the feed. I’ve done research and searched on many niche and generic search terms. Most of the results were handmade and hand designed items. They have a \~40% reduction in search results where >25% of listings look a like.

I downloaded the app for my DD but i was scrolling for hours because it had good recommendations and inspiration for handmade items. It felt like using Pinterest before it got ridden with ads. Like browsing Tumblr before it got ruined.

Focus on gift giving gift recommendations per occasion and who you are shopping for. Investments into app development, marketing, expansion in the breath + sophistication of their data and integration of AI and GenAI.

1732004236.0,Wallstreet forecasts 'normal' year for stocks in 2025 - Some guy on the Internet disagrees.,"According to yahoo finance [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-forecasts-normal-year-for-stocks-in-2025-after-historic-rally-182124444.html) and [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-forecasts-p-500-054053974.html) several big financial institutions see the S&P moderating to a ""normal"" growth rate with the hype over AI starting to wane and a likely transition into other sectors. These are very reasonable assessments, if you make your prognosis on the base of efficient market behaviour.

So why would some rando - yours truly - troll these halls of wisdom with a random theory of what is going to happen? The answer is simple: That is what we do on WSB. Also, I have bullet points:

  
1st: The efficient market is dead. After the election massive amounts of retail investors have swept into the stock market and cryptocurrencies. According to [some video I saw on the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P03PfYgNjmw&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW&index=20) when large amounts of retail investors get into the market, the ""efficiency"" suffers, meaning, the market does not find the right prices for equities and beins to overprice them.

  
2nd. According to [another video on the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5PF2PcElV0&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW&index=19) (just coincidentally from the same ""youtuber"") the human brain is evolutionary not equipped, to stop greeding after more profit, once it started seeing progress. This is true for professional investors and even much more so for significantly less sophisticated individuals without the saftey net of a risk desk. This means the people, who stream into the stock market and cryptocurrencies right now, will not stop driving the prices up.

  
3rd. I´ve done my own research (watching those videos on the internet) and it says, that only two options stop us in those tracks: Learning through losses to take less risk and price more realistically or going broke. I find ""my research"" heavily supported in this subreddit.

  
4th. Market efficiency will further erode by currently unpredictable effects of an unknown, but likely rather disrupting policy. This will cause for some investors the pain, necessary to adapt or leave the market, for others it will cause massive gains, which will draw even more less sophistcated traders in.

  
5th. Given the limited sophistication, these investors are likely to focus on a limited range of assets, which are well represented in the media: AI and cryptocurrencies. This will lead to a continuing strong and overperforming bull run, drawing other investments up in it´s wake, but only on a limited scale.

  
6th. Companies will use this opportunity to launch extremely well doing IPOs.

  
7th. This bull run will end in a crash, because - according to my research on the internet and a couple of decades watching the hoax establishment news - it always does. Keep in mind, that this event does not necessarily have to happen in 2025.

  
8th. That market crash will wipe out massive amounts of wealth, ruin existences and make other filthy, filthy rich. Usually the latter are those, who were already filthy, filthy rich before. Unsophisticated investors will leave the market or be forced to leave and the markets become significantly more efficient again.

  
7th. Doing my own research means, I have to put foward conclusions. I weighed mine at least for several minutes while writing this text, so they are highly reliable predictions, but I still warn anybody from mistaking them for financial advice or antyhing else than demigodly prohecies:

  
\- The crash of the stock market will not lead to an extinction event, but a selection event. While companies will get wiped out, those, which survive will dominate the stock market just like the mag7 now, which are basically the survivors of the dotcom crash.

  
\- The crash of the cryptocurrency market will lead to an extinction event. It will wipe out most of cypto investors and funds/ETFs. This is due to the simple fact, that the market is way to much of a single economic niche. After that it may recover up to a point.

  
tl;dr: The efficient market is dead - long live the goldrush.",wallstreetbets

1731997145.0,Some thought from first year stock investment,"This month marks roughly the first year of my serious financial investment. The returning is satisfying.

I’d like to share some thought.

**My label**

1.Long-term investing on the product of market

[2.You](http://2.You) an Never Make Money Beyond Your Cognitive Abilities

**Important material I’ve read**

1.Youtube: How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio

2.The Little Book of Common Sense Investing

3.Psycology of money

**Thought**

Part of my money is on sp500 related. Besides this, I still did some stock picking, which is I really want to share.

1.Nvdia:Never sold out, keep buying

Three reasons: 

a.I deeply believe productivity gain is the most powerful drive for economy growth(read it from How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio). 

b.GenAI dramatically improves productivity.

c.Nvidia is the cornerstone of the GenAI

2.PAN:Hold 

I bought some last Dec. In March, the CEO announced the strategy change of the company, the stock dropped by 30%。This does not affect me at all since I am in this industry and their strategy is not bad.

Now the price came back even higher.

3.Tesla: Bought below 200 and then sold out after “We robot” event. I was disappointed on the bland event

We all know what is going on now. LOL

4.Crowdstrike:

Sold out after outage.

**I really don’t understand it.. How come the stock price of company with this huge mistake still came back. The customers still believe in the reliability of the company product? or other competitors are so behind?**

This black swan event can dramatically affect my cognization.

5.Palantir

Seriously considered and decided not buy. Now it is 6x.

6.Micron, Dell, qualcomm

Mediumlconsidered and decided not buying it.

Since I watch news everyday, I noticed some good quarterly report and  stock gain. so want to jump in.

I don’t feel strong confidence, the drive is from its recent performance and their AI-related product, but I still feel doubt of them and don’t have strong internal acknowledge of the products.

===

This year really get me deeper understanding of my own mindset and the market

Big lessons:

When you don’t have rational confidence of a company, you are much emotionally affected by single event and the market. 

Business acumen: should’ve seriously considered Tesla before election. 

Biggest Mistake:

I still got tricked into making more transaction due to make more money mindset.",wallstreetbets

1731982227.0,I think my friend sold me my calls on $SMCI,"I swear on my mother’s eyes. I’m sitting there like a fing genius looking at my hood gambling account, staring at the SMCI chart and reading all this bullshit regards are spewing on twitter about the stock getting delisted. Luckly, I just came out of a similar trade on B.Riley and kinda figured if those frauds can get away with not filing financials on time for over 180 days and they are still trading, there is no way SMCI will get delisted.

I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a \~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5. Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh

Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business. My phone buzzes, and it’s my buddy. This guy texts me out of nowhere, “Man, I think I’m fucked. I sold $34.5 naked calls on SMCI this week. Thought it’d be easy money.”

So I’m like, waiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.. I check my broker app and look at the open interest on these contracts, and my jaw hits the goddamn floor. The open interest is 257. lol. **257 contracts**, and your boy here owns **250** of them. I’m the goddamn other side of his trade! I'm the guy that said yuuuuuuuuuup I'll take those off your hands sir. 

If everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f\*\*\*ing check for $62,000 (so far).

He knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know **how many** or **what strike**. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money.

Now I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy.

So that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do?

1731978751.0,SMCI sucks and you're a sucker for buying it ,"The way it's run is halarious, it's essentially a couple brothers robbing the investors. They buy property to rent to SMCI for over market value. The CEO then circulates parts around shell companies owned by his brothers to then sell back to SMCI for more, successfully scalping money from the company into their private companies. To boost stock price, they recognize revenue on sales that are not yet completed by faking deliveries. Now their top clients are ditching them for others, and they have no moat. In fact their services suck. There's literally 0 reason to invest in this company that is heading for the ground 


Also, a very important detail: Charles (CEO of SMCI) has been bff with Jensen Huang for a long time. This is why this uncompetitive company has been given almost exclusive supplier status for Nividia. After the scandal, Jensen is pulling orders away to save Nividia from backlash. There's no growth story here. It's a guy giving his buddy an allowance and will remain that way for the foreseeable future.

80 87.5C 8/15/2025 @ 6.58 avg (~52k)

DD:

TLDR; Walmart is poised to easily gain +20-30% over the next year. In conjunction with incredibly cheap LEAPs (20% IV) this means the potential for two caniac combos worth of tendies. 

The Overview 
Walmart has seen almost a 30% gain since last earnings as investors are piling in on the presumption that increased automation and E-Commerce will improve top and bottom lines. What is less talked about right now is the effect the Trump administration will have on Walmart and its domestic competitors. Walmart sources almost 2/3s of its products domestically in the US. In fact, Walmart has direct relationships with US suppliers and manufacturers— this has been a core part of their business model in limiting costs (and food prices, as we will get to). Walmarts competitors, however, mostly source abroad: Target for example has almost 49% of its supplying factories based in China alone. Yea, that’s right— the same China Trump wants to slap massive import tariffs on. So what happens when Walmarts competitors raise prices? Well, there’s a couple options (all of which are either favorable or neutral to Walmart). Either A) Competitors raise prices; Walmart does not on its domestic products and they subsequently capture a much larger market share as consumers flock to cheap Walmart name brand goods (tendies) B) Competitors raise prices and Walmart uses it as an excuse to raise prices as well; profit margins go up while market share stays approximately the same (tendies) or C) this analysis is wrong and Walmart is hit just as hard as its competitors; the automation, E-Commerce platforms, and foreign markets Walmart is attempting to get market share in (and the market is obsessed with) continue to bear fruit, and we are left either up or approximately the same (kids meal tendies). This is in conjunction with the fact that Walmart has reported that consumers from all income strata have already begun switching to Walmart items from competitor’s stores (read, brand loyalty is in the gutter) making any price discrepancies between Walmart and its competitors have a magnified effect on consumer demand. 

Execution:
But why the hell would I yolo in Walmart which might only go up 20-30% if you are right instead of other, juicier stocks that could move more? It’s because the relative stability of Walmart’s stock over the past several years works massively in our favor. 7 month ATM LEAPS are priced with 20% IV in mind (+10% break even), or roughly 6.50 per option. You regards spend more time value premium on a Tesla monthly call than a year long Walmart one. This means we can eliminate much of the risk of this DD (timing the market) and exaggerate the gains from that “small” 20-30% move. We are talking a 3-4x of your investment from a -mostly- theta safe investment. And remember, that’s from at the money LEAPS. This is what makes this investment choice such a juicy opportunity for us.",wallstreetbets

1731961482.0,betting big on jnpr: waiting for doj’s green light on hpe’s $40/share offer,"alright, degenerates, here’s the breakdown. hewlett packard enterprise (hpe) is set to acquire juniper networks (jnpr) for $14 billion, offering $40 per share, which is a solid premium over where jnpr is trading now. the deal has already cleared the uk’s competition and markets authority (cma), and we’re just waiting on the u.s. department of justice (doj) for the final decision. since the european commission has already approved, there’s some optimism that the doj will follow suit, but nothing is ever guaranteed.

why does this matter? well, if the doj gives the green light, jnpr shareholders get a nice payout at $40 per share. this move also strengthens hpe’s ai-driven networking capabilities, setting them up to compete harder against cisco and other big players in the market.

but let’s talk about risks. the doj could still throw a wrench into this deal if they have antitrust concerns, and if that happens, jnpr’s stock could take a serious hit. there’s a lot riding on regulatory approval, and if the market senses any delay or trouble, the premium baked into the stock price could disappear fast.

so, what’s the play? one option is buying jnpr calls with strike prices below $40, expiring after the doj’s expected decision. this could pay off big if everything goes smoothly. alternatively, you could just buy shares and hold, hoping for the $40 payout. just remember, if the deal falls apart, you’re exposed to the downside.

1731959902.0,How RFK Jr. Could Make $HIMS Great Again,"**TL;DR:** Investors are pulling back from pharmaceutical stocks as RFK Jr. has been appointed to lead HHS, creating an opportunity for $HIMS stock while it is still undervalued. If RFK pushes to block Medicare/Medicaid coverage of costly anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound, people could turn to more affordable alternatives like $HIMS. In 2022, Medicare alone spent over $4.6 billion on Ozempic, and that number likely ballooned in 2023/2024. As RFK targets big pharma, affordable GLP-1 drugs from $HIMS and similar platforms could become the go-to option.

**Pharma Pullback**

Criticisms of the pharmaceutical industry by RFK Jr. have led to uncertainty in big pharma, resulting in a sell-off. This sell-off has indirectly affected companies like $HIMS, as some investors are unsure of his stance on anti-obesity drugs. Understanding RFK’s viewpoint on these drugs can help us strategize for potential market opportunities.

**GLP-1 Reliance**

After individuals have been using GLP-1 medications for some time, they may need to continue the treatment long-term to maintain its benefits. This ongoing requirement creates a strong and sustained business opportunity surrounding these drugs.

GLP-1 receptor agonists, like semaglutide (Ozempic) and tirzepatide, are widely used for weight loss. According to Martin Whyte, an associate professor of metabolic medicine, these drugs provide doses far greater than the body naturally produces, suppressing the body’s ability to produce GLP-1 on its own. This can lead to increased hunger when people stop taking the medication, making weight regain almost inevitable.

A study published in the **Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)** found that placebo users gained 7% of their weight back compared to those who continued taking GLP-1 drugs, who saw an average weight loss of -7.9%. If Medicare/Medicaid stops covering these drugs, patients will either regain weight or seek affordable alternatives like $HIMS, which offers GLP-1 treatments for $200 per month, compared to the $1,300 a month of the name brand

**RFK's Stance on Obesity Drugs**

RFK doesn’t oppose obesity drugs themselves but believes that the core problem of obesity lies in the poor quality of food in the U.S. He has criticized pharmaceutical giants like Novo Nordisk for their focus on selling to Americans while ignoring the underlying health crisis.

RFK has pointed out that the massive spending on drugs like Ozempic could be better spent on improving food systems and promoting healthier lifestyles. He critiques that while Novo Nordisk profits from Ozempic sales in the U.S.,  its home country focuses on diet and exercise as obesity solutions. His criticism aligns with an agenda to move away from pharmaceutical dependency as solution to obesity.

**Why This Matters for $HIMS**

Medicare spent more than $4.6 billion on Ozempic in 2022, and the widespread adoption of these GLP-1 drugs likely pushed that figure higher in 2024. The FDA approval of drugs like Wegovy as anti-obesity treatments has most likely ballooned spending.

The following chart illustrates the rapid increase in sales of GLP-1-based anti-obesity medications over the recent year. Wegovy and Zepbound sales have skyrocketed, reflecting the strong demand for weight-loss treatments.

If RFK succeeds in restricting Medicare/Medicaid coverage for these expensive weight-loss drugs, people will look for more affordable solutions. This opens an opportunity for $HIMS, which offers GLP-1 drugs at a much lower cost via its platform. As mainstream options become restricted, $HIMS could see a significant boost in demand.

* [CNBC Coverage](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/medicare-can-cover-weight-loss-drugs-if-used-for-added-health-benefit.html)

While there are many possible scenarios, my research suggests that this is a path forward. With RFK’s push to limit big pharma influence, $HIMS may emerge as a key player in the affordable weight management space.

1732129689.0,$RIVN: Riding to Valhalla,"Alright, degenerates. Rivian isn’t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore—it’s the ex-nerd who’s going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you’re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.

## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver

**Tesla’s Fumbling the Ball** 

Elon’s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they’re turning the corner to RIVN, who’s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla’s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian’s already at brunch ordering mimosas.

**How Rivian Could Ride Trump’s EV Rollercoaster**

You’d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here’s the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely “America First” policies. With Rivian’s production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump’s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian’s set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone’s FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it’s only a matter of time until the market realizes this.

**New Models That’ll Make You Feel Things** 

Let’s talk about Rivian’s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it’s the hot-but-affordable option that’s ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla’s Supercharger network? That’s not just sexy—that’s full-blown EV porn. This isn’t a one-night stand; Rivian’s building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn’t inclusive enough for you Wendy’s employees, they’re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).

**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** 

Sure, Rivian’s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they’ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they’ve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That’s efficiency, baby.

**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**

 Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They’re hyped about Rivian’s leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.

RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they’re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company’s market cap isn’t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they’re only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian’s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW’s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian’s like the guy spending money he doesn’t have to impress his date. Sure, it’s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it’s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he’s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that’s all he talks about? Hell no, he’ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn’t just another EV play—it’s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian’s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock’s the real deal, and I’m strapping in for the ride.

1732114947.0,$ACHR The Bull Run Hasn't Started Yet," **TLDR:** Current fair value is +$10imo, Archer is currently the leader and will likely be the first to market, Major upcoming catalysts: Factory opening by the end of next month, Initiation of manufacturing in Jan, Final FAA certification, and Trump Presidency.

 Archer Aviation ($ACHR) recently delivered a strong Q3 earnings call, highlighting significant advancements in their journey to commercialize eVTOL technology. With robust financials, strategic partnerships, New Trump Administration, and progress in FAA certification, Archer is positioning itself to outpace competitors and become the first to market in the eVTOL industry. 

# Archer Will Likely Be The First To Market

Archer Aviation ($ACHR) is likely to be the **first to market** in the eVTOL industry, even outpacing Joby Aviation. How? Their focus on **scalability and an efficient supply chain** sets them apart. They've strategically outsourced about **80% of their major components** to established **Tier 1 suppliers** who have FAA certification expertise. This traditional aerospace model **reduces development risks, speeds up the certification process, and taps into existing supply chains for faster scalability.** Basically, they're not trying to reinvent the wheel, and it's paying off big time. This approach reduces development risks, speeds up the certification process, and utilizes existing supply chains for faster scalability.

In contrast, Joby follows a vertically integrated model, designing and manufacturing most components in-house, which allows for greater control and potentially higher performance but involves higher capital costs, longer certification timelines, and scaling challenges due to the novelty of its components. This difference in strategy positions Archer for a quicker and more efficient path to market.

As **Archer tweeted on Friday**, Archer's type-design is now **matured**, and they're ready to start producing piloted aircraft as soon as their **factory opens** at the **end of this year.** These aircraft will be operational by the beginning of 2025, with plans for piloted demonstrations and market survey flights with passengers throughout the year.

# Trumps Interest in VTOLs and The New Secretary of Transportation

President Donald Trump recently announced his administration’s support for VTOL technology, recognizing its transformative potential for economic growth and national security. Adding to this momentum, among Trump's picks for Secretary of Transportation is **Emil Michael**. If appointed, he has close ties to **Archer’s Chief Commercial Officer, Nihil Goel as he tweeted on Saturday.** This relationship could facilitate smoother regulatory pathways for Archer as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) finalizes critical rules for advanced air mobility. With the **new Trump administration,** Archer is poised to **benefit** from from significant political and regulatory tailwinds that could accelerate its growth in a market projected to reach **$1 trillion by 2040**.

# Financially Strong As Mentioned in Q3 Call

As mentioned in their Q3 call, Archer ended the quarter with over **$500 million** in cash reserves(with an additional 400M unaccounted for). With a quarterly cash burn of about **$80-90 million**, this gives them a solid **18-month runway**. This strong cash position is further **strengthened** by their partnership with **Stellantis**, which has agreed to contribute up to **$400 million** to help scale the manufacturing of Archer's Midnight aircraft. This capital **will cover manufacturing labor costs and capital expenditures for initial production at their new facility in Georgia.** By outsourcing 80% of their components to established suppliers, they've managed to keep operational costs in check while accelerating production timelines.

Additionally, Archer has issued **$30 million** in performance warrants to Stellantis, which will vest upon achieving certain milestones. They also have contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense worth up to **$148 million**.

# AHCR Fair valuation +$10

 After their Q3 earnings call, Archer received many analyst upgrades ranging between $10-12 PT. While Archer is ahead of JOBY in my opinion and will enter the market first, currently there's such a significant difference in market caps between Archer and Joby.

Joby is trading at **$6.14** with a market cap of **$4.72 billion**, while **Archer Aviation (ACHR)** is at **$5.00** with a market cap of only **$2.15 billion**. If we compare apples to apples, Archer should be valued potentially around **$12**. In fact, Archer is ahead imo due to its scalability, reliance on established parts suppliers, and lower costs. Their strategy will speeds up the FAA certification process and allows for quicker scalability. On the other hand, Joby's vertically integrated model, while offering more control, comes with higher capital costs, longer certification timelines, and scaling challenges. This difference in approach positions Archer for a faster and more efficient path to market, making the current valuation gap seem unjustified.

1732112527.0,Ford to make massive job cuts in Europe due to EV transition and increased competition,"Ford Motor ( F ) said on Wednesday it would cut about 14 per cent of its European workforce, citing significant losses suffered by the company in recent years, combined with weak demand for electric vehicles, a lack of government support for the transition to electric vehicles and increased competition.

The U.S. company is the latest automaker to cut costs, following Nissan, Stellantis and General Motors, as the industry faces challenges from growing competition from European Chinese rivals, waning demand in China and a shift to electric vehicles that are out of reach for most consumers.

Ford said the 4,000 job cuts were mainly in Germany and Britain. Globally, the job cuts represent about 2.3 per cent of Ford's 174,000 employees.

The moves will hit especially hard in Germany, Europe's largest economy and biggest carmaker, where Volkswagen has threatened to close factories, slash wages and cut thousands of jobs to improve its competitiveness.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-cut-14-european-jobs-133149441.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-cut-14-european-jobs-133149441.html)",wallstreetbets

According to the current speculation, Nvidia's third-quarter revenue (EPS) is expected to be $0.74 for $33.2 billion, up 83% year-over-year, respectively. Of this, revenue from the data centre division is expected to reach $29 billion, an increase of 100% from the same period last year. Gaming Revenue



Investors are not only focusing on the financial performance of the third quarter, but also on whether Nvidia will adjust its earnings estimates for the fourth quarter. Analysts are still predicting $37 billion for the fourth quarter. However, even if the earnings report exceeds expectations, Nvidia's stock will still hit $37 billion. The possible decline could be partly due to the market its earnings expectations have trended higher, or investors



Also, Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI chips are expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue for the company, but shipments of the series have been delayed, mainly due to overheating issues affecting servers, which may be its installations in data centres. , the current government department may impose tariffs on global products, especially on chips made in Taiwan, giving Nvidia levy uncertainty. Since most of Nvidia's chips are made by Taiwan's TSMC, the tariffs could raise the price of AI chips, which could affect its profit margins or pass the cost on to customers.



These signs could lead to a less-than-expected market reaction. It could create uncertainty for Nvidia's future. Do you think these potential risks will affect Nvidia's long-term growth?

1732108978.0,Why now's the time to short MSTR,"Scroll to bottom for tl;dr.

As a lot of you regards probably saw already yesterday the CEO of Rumble tweeted a poll  asking whether they should buy BTC, and Michael Saylor responded that they should. The Rumble CEO then responded that he'd DM Michael to discuss. Since MSTR stock has gone up so much thanks to this wonderful strategy the obvious conclusion is that this will be good for Rumble as well, which is why Rumble stock shot up a few % after this Twitter exchange and as of the time of writing this it's up a few more % in premarket.

Ok so that's all nice and boring but why does that mean I should short MSTR? Well here's the thing. MSTR has gone up a lot not just because the BTC it holds has gone up, but more so because its stock trades at such a high premium to the value of this BTC (around 150% premium currently). So it can sell stock and use the money to buy more BTC, which adds even more value to the stock price. The point is that this premium is hugely important to the stock price. People are buying MSTR at an insane premium to get exposure to BTC without having to buy it directly or buy ETFs etc. If this demand for MSTR stock goes away, the premium will close and the stock will crash. But that's exactly what will happen if Rumble and other companies start buying BTC. There will be more stocks that investors can choose to buy for BTC exposure instead of just MSTR, which will cause their premium to crash.

So the play here is to short MSTR and buy BTC as a hedge. This trade will print as more companies get into the ""buying BTC to serve as a vessel for investors"" market and MSTR's premium to BTC collapses.

tl:dr: MSTR's premium will collapse as Rumble and other companies buy BTC and MSTR's monopoly on being a BTC vessel for investors goes away. Sell MSTR and buy BTC to profit from this.",wallstreetbets

1732091429.0,$hood YOLO 40k . Will 250+ in 3-4 years ,"YOLO $hood go to $100 by mid 2025

Not financial advice but $hood will be $100 in no time in 1-2 years. Yolo’d 40k last year on June (yes I know long term capital gains thank god).

Okay! So. Their last earning report was missed… WHY?! Recently they were running promotions during the past months-  marketing customers switch brokage (robinhood  was essentially burning their cash) which made up a huge percentage of their expenses in the short term.Practically sacrificing CASH for customer loyalty. It was an edgy but risky move. It wasn’t a no brainer that they missed their recent earnings report by a small percentage. This is their game plan. Hood’s expectation is that… customers are more likely to invest with that said capital once they see it. ALSO… since the promotion is about to end, (I think it has already) their upcoming earnings report will beat expectations by a TON. If not, definitely the next one. Due to saved expenses. Compared to Coinbase, Robinhood is the jack of all trades where young investors will have an entry to learn how to invest. People believe that $hood is undervalued, but I confidently say it is still super undervalued. Keep in mind. Coinbase is 300+ in shares price because they withhold 50 BILLION plus of crypto equity. 

Funny thing is that.. I was using Charles Schwab the other day and it was fucking hard to find my entry cost. Their mobile UI is terrible to say the least. Spent 5-7 minutes tapping buttons and I STILL couldn’t find my cost.

Another thing. Their recent acquisition of TradePMR- wealth management corp. This move will essentially set their ground footing towards a banking industry.. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were to acquired SOFI. Adding in Futures + Index and the desktop app that they’ve recently released, would be another reason and THE pinnacle of their success. In the future $hood will be a Bank. 

All in all… I believe $hood will shoot up to $100 very easily. In the next 4-5 years  $250+. Mark my words. ",wallstreetbets

A small write up on the company:

ASML is the Dutch manufacturer of advanced semiconductor equipments and lithographic machines.

They have the EUV [Extreme Ultra Voilet] technology to produce machines to craft 5 nm and smaller size chips. These are the latest AI chips used for very high performance tasks like training LLM models etc.

Nvidia and other foundaries (TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix) depend on ASML machines.

But their workhorse is DUV [Deep Ultra Voilet] technology which is used for manufacturing non AI chips and far exceed requirements in form of less intensive but more utilitarian forms like house hold appliances, cars, home laptops, computers etc.

Chinese have developed/acquired DUV technology and are able to produce upto 7 nm chips at a fraction of the cast. DUV machine may be used to produce 5 nm chips but it will lack density and in computing power. Some unconfirmed reports have stated that Chinese have made significant progress in EUV technology but we are yet to see an actual proof of that. 

US govt have put restrictions on US, EU, Korea and Taiwan based chip manufacuturers to provide latest AI chips or manchines to manufacture latest AI chips.",wallstreetbets

1732069285.0,Back to break even!!,"Hey y’all,

I tried posting this earlier but got removed for post being too short so here I am again

A couple weeks ago [I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ghf3gq/shakeschangecup/) of how I had started trading in July of this year with $10k.

In about 90 days I was able to get up to $15k and I cashed out my earnings bringing me back to $10k.

At this same time I discovered options \*cue people screaming and jumping out fire escapes\*. I failed miserabley losing 75% of my portfolio in a week. I know, I know.

I didn’t give up. Nov 4 I was just barely above $2k and I told myself I’d climb out the hole no matter what.

I’m glad to say that just about 2 weeks later I’M BACK TO $10K!!!!!

How did I do it? I looked back at my strategies and figured out what was working vs. what went wrong and decided to revert to my original strategy and it worked! My girlfriend is no longer giving me the side eye!

Big shout outs to Blackrock (again, I know), MSTR, and TSLA among many others for getting me back to my starting point.

What I learned? believe in yourself first and foremost, and don’t give up

See y’all at $20k! ;)

1732056879.0,Stocks shrug off war worries ahead of NVIDIA results?,"Stocks are rallying, with shares of NVIDIA Corp. rising ahead of earnings. Bitcoin extended its post-election rally

Options trading suggests that NVIDIA's earnings announcement on Wednesday will be the most important catalyst of the year - even more important than the Federal Reserve's December meeting, Barclays strategists said. Shares of the chipmaker, which is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom, rose 4.9 per cent, leading the Standard & Poor's 500 Index higher. Earlier stock market declines were driven by Ukraine's first U.S. missile launch into Russia and President Vladimir Putin's approval of an updated nuclear strategy

For Gaurav Mallik of Pallas Capital Advisors, geopolitical uncertainty did contribute to the volatility. As for Nvidia's results, he expects them to be strong, citing capital spending by big tech companies and what he sees as ‘no obvious alternatives’ to the company's chips

1732048483.0,Let it $SNOW,"Let's face it, $SNOW has been one of the most disappointing-performing stocks of the year. While $NVDA is riding the AI wave, and $MSTR is riding the BTC boom, $SNOW has been sitting here like a fat child eating cake and shitting himself in the process.

But this is all about to change, and let's discuss why:

1. Winter is coming, and people will associate $SNOW with warm fuzzy feelings while drinking hot cocoa by the fireplace. This is inherently bullish.
2. $SNOW has historically always beaten revenue estimates (bullish), and 88% of the time it beats EPS estimates. I expect this time to be no different (beat both revenue and EPS), however this is never enough to rally this stock (more below).
3. $SNOW has been hiring like crazy. I know because I've applied twice so far and been rejected both times (smart choice on their part - bullish), which means they're being picky and likely receiving a lot of strong candidates to improve their offering (extra bullish). I've been keeping an eye on all open positions, along with how long they're open for, and new ones that pop up. Everything I've seen indicates a hiring frenzy to expand into more markets, take on new clients, etc.
4. $SNOW tends to retain their customers and strengthen existing relationships. Just today they announced a stronger partnership with $MSFT by releasing a new platform to work with $MSFT Power Platform (bullish AF)
5. In May, $SNOW appointed Sridhar Ramaswamy as the new CEO, who is expected to focus on enhancing the company's AI (bullish) product strategy.
6. Going off the point above, the actual real-world numbers of customers using their AI product is genuinely exploding, and we all know how bullish AI is in today's market. 

**Q**: Ok, but why is THIS time different than all the other earnings reports when $SNOW crashed and burned?

**A**: Like I said in Point 2 above, we Snowflakians always beat revenue and EPS predictions, but for some reason the stock always goes down. The reason behind this - as is the consensus of analysts - is that investors are cautious against how much money $SNOW is pouring into their products, R&D, and operating costs. This quarter we should start to actually see the results of these investments, returning strong usage statistics and a healthy increase in overall adoption from the industry.

**Q**: Ok, but what about, like, Databricks and stuff?

**A**: Databricks can suck my nuts (they also haven't hired me yet - I'm trying to get in before they go public for those sweet stock gainz)

**My Positions** (Screenshot below):

1732045774.0,$VRT ➡️ S&P 500: Coming Soon,"Vertiv ($VRT) has been ripping all year and is up 190% YTD fueled by continuous AI & data center demand.  I think it has a high likelihood of being **added to the S&P 500 during the Q4 rebalancing** which will be announced Dec 6th. I'll share a brief overview of $VRT and then my thinking behind the S&P 500 inclusion.

*Position*: $VRT shares, 2025 & 2026 leaps  
*Disclaimer*: not financial advice, do your own research  
*Other analysts if you don't trust random redditors:*   
\- RadnorCapital on X  
\- Institutional analysts: [NASDAQ $VRT](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vrt/analyst-research)

# Company Analysis

**High level company overview:**  
[Vertiv Holdings Co.](https://www.vertiv.com/en-us/) *engages in the design, manufacture, and service of critical digital infrastructure technology that powers, cools, deploys, secures and maintains electronics that process, store and transmit data. It also offers power management products, thermal management products, integrated rack systems, modular solutions, and management systems for monitoring and controlling digital infrastructure.* 

**Leadership team:**

[Mr. Albertazzi?? absolute stud + italian](https://preview.redd.it/gluw4pmapw1e1.png?width=2552&format=png&auto=webp&s=9514eeb811f9d6fe57a756932c46dc81c9548d82)

**Financial Overview**:  
Strong financials across the board and continue to raise guidance. 2024 guidance confirmed, data is here:

Net Sales: $7,805M, organic up 14%  
Adj. Operating Profit: $1,485M  
Adj. Operating Margin: 19.0%, up 370 bps  
Adj. Free Cash Flow: $1,000M

Another overall view from today's investor day presentation, the full deck can be found here: [Nov 18 - Investor Day](https://s23.q4cdn.com/959471387/files/doc_presentations/Vertiv-2024-Investor-Event-Presentation.pdf).

[Balance Sheet Metrics](https://preview.redd.it/ed3ayuigow1e1.png?width=2552&format=png&auto=webp&s=8471b4d6ccead1f63e7929882fe38b85ed9930f1)

Fundamentally I think they have some **key advantages** that will allow for them to continue to dominate the market:

(1) AI-Demand & Margin Expansion: Multiple levers for continued further expansion of adjusted operating margin to \~25% in 2029 (Slide 14 & 36)  
(2) Product Leadership: Vertiv services provide unmatched critical digital infrastructure support (Slide 26-28)  
(3) Flexible Capital: $12.5B of capital deployment through 2029. Up from $6.5B at Nov 2023 Investor Day (Slide 48)  
(4) Energy Demand: Power and cooling capabilities are already crucial today, as energy demand surges, efficiency and cost will become a major factor

**Risks**  
\- AI Bubble: tbh I'm not a believer in this narrative but its something to consider since their sales are driven by AI related companies  
\- $NVDA: $VRT trades with $NVDA (so does the market in a way) but if you pull up the charts there is high correlation. Also $NVDA ER is tomorrow  
\- Valuation: They trade at a 81.86 PE ratio 

# S&P 500 Inclusion

The S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs 4x/year with the next one coming up. [SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en) announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed.

S&P rebalancing presents an opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is potential for a \~5-10% price increase. In short, the rebalance forces institutions who follow certain indexes to buy the stock as it is now in the index & generally there is a positive impact on company's reputation.

Although the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here: [SP 500 Criteria](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf), there is a bit of thematic flexibility. By definition the index is ""a market cap-weighted index of US large- and mid-cap stocks."" Typically companies need to be $18B or larger in market cap and historically profitable. Negative trailing EPS, high volatility, recent IPO, etc. may restrict a stock from eligibility.

Below is the **SP 500 index sector weighting** (as of Nov 14):  
Technology: 33.32% | Financial Services: 13.19% | Consumer Cyclical: 10.80% |. Healthcare: 10.54% | Communication Services: 9.03% | Industrials: 7.58% | Consumer Defensive: 5.56% | Energy: 3.44% | Utilities: 2.54% | Real Estate: 2.17% | Basic Materials: 1.83%

**Why Vertiv ($VRT)?**

* Thematic fit: the index is focused on representing the best small/mid cap companies in the US and $VRT fits the industrial/energy category (the industry will get more love under the new administration), it fits the innovation/technology aspect, and of course the energy/AI theme 
* Solid earnings and growth: self-explanatory in the company financial analysis above
* Strong momentum: this is important and imho, an underrated factor. A great example of this is Palantir ($PLTR) which btw pumped like 10% off of the news. Now I know r/wallstreetbets has a love/hate relationship with $PLTR but put that aside for now (it was added to the index around $35)

**Rebalance Timeline**: [Q4 2024 ](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/ICE_NYSE_2024_Yearly_Trading_Calendar.pdf)  
\*based on the usual schedule, check the website for official announcements

* Quarter End Date: Dec 31
* Announcement Date: Early December (typically 1st week)
* Rebalance Date: Dec 20 (typically 3rd Friday)

# Closing Note

I will be waiting until after NVIDIA reports earnings on 11/20 to make any adjustments to this trade or to rethink my thesis. Would recommend this especially if you do not already have a position in $VRT.

They reduced by 33% impressions of looking back (previous purchases) changed to looking for something new (inspiration and idea’s). Their app now feels and looks like a big Pinterest inspiration board with endless handmade and hand designed items.

***Etsy will repurchase up to an additional $1 billion of their common stock.***

They have spend the last Q3 on improving the search. Before the search results would be full of Aliexpress crap for about most of the feed. I’ve done research and searched on many niche and generic search terms. Most of the results were handmade and hand designed items. They have a \~40% reduction in search results where >25% of listings look a like.

I downloaded the app for my DD but i was scrolling for hours because it had good recommendations and inspiration for handmade items. It felt like using Pinterest before it got ridden with ads. Like browsing Tumblr before it got ruined.

Focus on gift giving gift recommendations per occasion and who you are shopping for. Investments into app development, marketing, expansion in the breath + sophistication of their data and integration of AI and GenAI.

**Position:** 52 shares in ETSY.  
**Next earnings:** 19 feb 2025.  
**Opinion:** Buy and hold, gift buying season is now, i expect next earnings to be good, buy shares for cheap.

1732194789.0,Why is $ASML down given AI future growth?  ,"Hi regards. I’m taking a poop posting this while my gf talks about dog costumes in the other room.

Moving on. Why is Dutch-based $ASML down given their monopoly on lithography machines? NVDA, for instance, cannot grow without them. You need their gear to make AI chips and stuff. They legit own this space with the closest competitor being Cannon (yes, the camera company) which is a far cry from where $ASML is with its lithography equipment. 

$ASML profit margins are typically about 50%. In the third quarter (Oct. 15), revenue was €7.5B in sales with ~51% profit. The CEO said there’s been a slowdown in some areas like “memory” (I honestly don’t know what that means) and projects 2025 revenue to be €30-€35B (€28B is projected for calendar year 2024). 

This stock hit nearly $1,100 about six months ago. It’s down to ~$650. Their lithography equipment is required for AI. 

If you’re betting on AI then how can you not bet on this company which serves as the only pick and shovel in town? 

I don’t own any shares and I am not a savvy stock person. I just buy shares like an idiot. But this community sometimes has great advice that’s made me wild gains. 

Anyone have insight on $ASML? Why is it taking such a beating? I can’t find much news.  ",wallstreetbets

There was no real way to invest in the s&p 500 unless you bought all 500 companies, constantly rebalanced equities, and rotated in and out new 500 companies... each time you'd get hit with capitol gains tax...

1732187516.0,$NOVA: Insiders can show you how and when you can double your money,"I will keep this short. The background is down below.

$NOVA insiders bought a lot of shares since it dropped recently. This is when you can also make money if you join them in the trade. See below for theory and practical application of this trade set up. The market already reacted to this but not fully, in my opinion.

https://preview.redd.it/5m6mg7xil82e1.png?width=1297&format=png&auto=webp&s=62e3c84d323d7851d2c558efd4777f5865a274ed

I traded the following options to bet on a rise and to finance the trade partially.

https://preview.redd.it/uk6avgdxk82e1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4f4c143b906eb1c7d17a4e519c148a1ef279e28

I am long this synthetic long position at a 10-3 ratio, meaning I am long 10 calls for each 3 short puts which I sold to finance the position. I am still at net debit, but much smaller if I just bought OTM calls.

The long calls are lottos which may or may not explode, but the short $4 puts are giving me long and sideways exposure to profit, as long as the stock is higher than $3.4. I picked this put strike because the insiders kept buying at these levels and there is margin of safety in the trade.

Good luck, trade small, and trade carefully.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to read the background on how insiders can show you when and how to double your money, see the original post and my follow up posts and trades. Here is a brief summary of my posts and trades:

1. VSTS - OG post, [posted on 5/10/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1coug3v/informed_traders_can_show_you_how_and_when_to/), stock was up a max 50% from the date
2. ATEC - [posted on 8/27/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f2qm8i/informed_traders_can_show_you_when_to_double_your/) the stock is now up 50% from the post date
3. PBF - [posted on 9/4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f92x8n/pbf_insiders_can_show_you_when_and_how_to_double/),  the stock is now down 5% form the post date

Interestingly, I made most money on PBF because I sold puts to recover the cost of the vertical spread, and I am still short $30 December puts. I made good money on ATEC even though my duration was short, and I barely made any money on the first trade on VSTS because it was a complex spread which did not work with the slow rise. This is just FIY on how you can use options but still make money in a sideways market, or lose money even if you pick the right direction, but you are wrong on duration.",wallstreetbets

1732186470.0,Why Nvidia may not follow the same fate as Cisco ,"The [Financial Times](https://www.linkedin.com/company/financial-times/) Lex with some fun facts on [NVIDIA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nvidia/)'s stock market dominance and what is much different about it compared to former market darling [Cisco](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cisco/):""Nvidia’s fortunes increasingly drive everyone else’s. 

At $3.6tn, the company is the world’s biggest by market capitalisation, and makes up **7️⃣**% of the S&P 500 index. Back in 2000 when Cisco briefly became the planet’s most valuable company, its weighting was less than **4️⃣**% of the S&P. 

As of Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock accounts for **2️⃣4️⃣**% of the index’s gains this year.

The result is that when Nvidia does well, animal spirits 🦍 rise across the market. [Bank of America](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bank-of-america/) analysts had calculated this week that investors were expecting a **1% index move** in response to Nvidia’s earnings — greater than the shift they expect from US inflation data later this month.

 In the short term, Nvidia has the enviable benefits of both scale and scarcity. 

Supply constraints keep prices high, and the company says demand for its new Blackwell chips will exceed its expectations of 'several billion dollars' in the current quarter. 

💸 Meanwhile, governments from Saudi Arabia to Denmark are seeking to build their own state-backed artificial intelligence initiatives, so while Silicon Valley depends on Nvidia, the reverse is becoming less true.

 That suggests the virtuous circle can continue. Whether that justifies a valuation of **3️⃣4️⃣** times forward earnings is up for grabs. Cisco stock, after a moment on top of the world, plunged during the dotcom crash, and never recovered.

 While Nvidia’s customers are paying hand over fist for chips driven by the promise of AI, it remains to be seen whether their customers — and their customers’ customers — will pay up for the resulting services too.💡

Nvidia has two things in its favour. First, its valuation is far behind the **1️⃣3️⃣0️⃣** times earnings Cisco enjoyed in 2000. Second, Huang has the benefit of hindsight and lavish profitability. Cisco’s earnings were **2️⃣0️⃣**% of its sales before the dotcom crash; Nvidia’s are nearly **6️⃣0️⃣**%.

 Spend that wisely, and his company will move the market for some time to come.""(+++Opinions are my own. Not investment advice. Do your own research.+++)",wallstreetbets

1732129689.0,$RIVN: Riding to Valhalla,"Alright, degenerates. Rivian isn’t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore—it’s the ex-nerd who’s going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you’re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.

## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver

**Tesla’s Fumbling the Ball** 

Elon’s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they’re turning the corner to RIVN, who’s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla’s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian’s already at brunch ordering mimosas.

**How Rivian Could Ride Trump’s EV Rollercoaster**

You’d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here’s the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely “America First” policies. With Rivian’s production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump’s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian’s set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone’s FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it’s only a matter of time until the market realizes this.

**New Models That’ll Make You Feel Things** 

Let’s talk about Rivian’s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it’s the hot-but-affordable option that’s ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla’s Supercharger network? That’s not just sexy—that’s full-blown EV porn. This isn’t a one-night stand; Rivian’s building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn’t inclusive enough for you Wendy’s employees, they’re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).

**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** 

Sure, Rivian’s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they’ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they’ve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That’s efficiency, baby.

**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**

 Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They’re hyped about Rivian’s leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.

RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they’re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company’s market cap isn’t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they’re only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.  


https://preview.redd.it/tc3jgmanu32e1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4d1888d8fc95e1f6fc9412032bb443304282aa

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian’s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW’s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian’s like the guy spending money he doesn’t have to impress his date. Sure, it’s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it’s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he’s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that’s all he talks about? Hell no, he’ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn’t just another EV play—it’s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian’s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock’s the real deal, and I’m strapping in for the ride.

And if I haven’t sold you on it, take it instead from this guy who turned $182k into $11.7 million:

1732114947.0,$ACHR The Bull Run Hasn't Started Yet," **TLDR:** Current fair value is +$10imo, Archer is currently the leader and will likely be the first to market, Major upcoming catalysts: Factory opening by the end of next month, Initiation of manufacturing in Jan, Final FAA certification, and Trump Presidency.

 Archer Aviation ($ACHR) recently delivered a strong Q3 earnings call, highlighting significant advancements in their journey to commercialize eVTOL technology. With robust financials, strategic partnerships, New Trump Administration, and progress in FAA certification, Archer is positioning itself to outpace competitors and become the first to market in the eVTOL industry. 

# Archer Will Likely Be The First To Market

Archer Aviation ($ACHR) is likely to be the **first to market** in the eVTOL industry, even outpacing Joby Aviation. How? Their focus on **scalability and an efficient supply chain** sets them apart. They've strategically outsourced about **80% of their major components** to established **Tier 1 suppliers** who have FAA certification expertise. This traditional aerospace model **reduces development risks, speeds up the certification process, and taps into existing supply chains for faster scalability.** Basically, they're not trying to reinvent the wheel, and it's paying off big time. This approach reduces development risks, speeds up the certification process, and utilizes existing supply chains for faster scalability.

In contrast, Joby follows a vertically integrated model, designing and manufacturing most components in-house, which allows for greater control and potentially higher performance but involves higher capital costs, longer certification timelines, and scaling challenges due to the novelty of its components. This difference in strategy positions Archer for a quicker and more efficient path to market.

As **Archer tweeted on Friday**, Archer's type-design is now **matured**, and they're ready to start producing piloted aircraft as soon as their **factory opens** at the **end of this year.** These aircraft will be operational by the beginning of 2025, with plans for piloted demonstrations and market survey flights with passengers throughout the year.

# Trumps Interest in VTOLs and The New Secretary of Transportation

President Donald Trump recently announced his administration’s support for VTOL technology, recognizing its transformative potential for economic growth and national security. Adding to this momentum, among Trump's picks for Secretary of Transportation is **Emil Michael**. If appointed, he has close ties to **Archer’s Chief Commercial Officer, Nihil Goel as he tweeted on Saturday.** This relationship could facilitate smoother regulatory pathways for Archer as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) finalizes critical rules for advanced air mobility. With the **new Trump administration,** Archer is poised to **benefit** from from significant political and regulatory tailwinds that could accelerate its growth in a market projected to reach **$1 trillion by 2040**.

# Financially Strong As Mentioned in Q3 Call

As mentioned in their Q3 call, Archer ended the quarter with over **$500 million** in cash reserves(with an additional 400M unaccounted for). With a quarterly cash burn of about **$80-90 million**, this gives them a solid **18-month runway**. This strong cash position is further **strengthened** by their partnership with **Stellantis**, which has agreed to contribute up to **$400 million** to help scale the manufacturing of Archer's Midnight aircraft. This capital **will cover manufacturing labor costs and capital expenditures for initial production at their new facility in Georgia.** By outsourcing 80% of their components to established suppliers, they've managed to keep operational costs in check while accelerating production timelines.

Additionally, Archer has issued **$30 million** in performance warrants to Stellantis, which will vest upon achieving certain milestones. They also have contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense worth up to **$148 million**.

# AHCR Fair valuation +$10

 After their Q3 earnings call, Archer received many analyst upgrades ranging between $10-12 PT. While Archer is ahead of JOBY in my opinion and will enter the market first, currently there's such a significant difference in market caps between Archer and Joby.

Joby is trading at **$6.14** with a market cap of **$4.72 billion**, while **Archer Aviation (ACHR)** is at **$5.00** with a market cap of only **$2.15 billion**. If we compare apples to apples, Archer should be valued potentially around **$12**. In fact, Archer is ahead imo due to its scalability, reliance on established parts suppliers, and lower costs. Their strategy will speeds up the FAA certification process and allows for quicker scalability. On the other hand, Joby's vertically integrated model, while offering more control, comes with higher capital costs, longer certification timelines, and scaling challenges. This difference in approach positions Archer for a faster and more efficient path to market, making the current valuation gap seem unjustified.

1732112527.0,Ford to make massive job cuts in Europe due to EV transition and increased competition,"Ford Motor ( F ) said on Wednesday it would cut about 14 per cent of its European workforce, citing significant losses suffered by the company in recent years, combined with weak demand for electric vehicles, a lack of government support for the transition to electric vehicles and increased competition.

The U.S. company is the latest automaker to cut costs, following Nissan, Stellantis and General Motors, as the industry faces challenges from growing competition from European Chinese rivals, waning demand in China and a shift to electric vehicles that are out of reach for most consumers.

Ford said the 4,000 job cuts were mainly in Germany and Britain. Globally, the job cuts represent about 2.3 per cent of Ford's 174,000 employees.

The moves will hit especially hard in Germany, Europe's largest economy and biggest carmaker, where Volkswagen has threatened to close factories, slash wages and cut thousands of jobs to improve its competitiveness.

I won't just focus on NVIDIA's last quarter's sales. I want to know if the chipmaker's next-generation Blackwell chip can maintain or even solidify its dominance in the AI chip industry

1732111759.0,"NVIDIA Q3 earnings preview: strong AI chip growth, but supply chain and tariff risks raise market concerns?","Nvidia is set to report its Q3 earnings after the close of trading today, an earnings report that will be crucial for investors to understand the latest developments in the AI industry.Nvidia, the world's largest publicly traded company by market capitalisation, has benefited from the AI tech



According to the current speculation, Nvidia's third-quarter revenue (EPS) is expected to be $0.74 for $33.2 billion, up 83% year-over-year, respectively. Of this, revenue from the data centre division is expected to reach $29 billion, an increase of 100% from the same period last year. Gaming Revenue



Investors are not only focusing on the financial performance of the third quarter, but also on whether Nvidia will adjust its earnings estimates for the fourth quarter. Analysts are still predicting $37 billion for the fourth quarter. However, even if the earnings report exceeds expectations, Nvidia's stock will still hit $37 billion. The possible decline could be partly due to the market its earnings expectations have trended higher, or investors



Also, Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI chips are expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue for the company, but shipments of the series have been delayed, mainly due to overheating issues affecting servers, which may be its installations in data centres. , the current government department may impose tariffs on global products, especially on chips made in Taiwan, giving Nvidia levy uncertainty. Since most of Nvidia's chips are made by Taiwan's TSMC, the tariffs could raise the price of AI chips, which could affect its profit margins or pass the cost on to customers.



These signs could lead to a less-than-expected market reaction. It could create uncertainty for Nvidia's future. Do you think these potential risks will affect Nvidia's long-term growth?

1732091429.0,$hood YOLO 40k . Will 250+ in 3-4 years ,"YOLO $hood go to $100 by mid 2025

Not financial advice but $hood will be $100 in no time in 1-2 years. Yolo’d 40k last year on June (yes I know long term capital gains thank god).

Okay! So. Their last earning report was missed… WHY?! Recently they were running promotions during the past months-  marketing customers switch brokage (robinhood  was essentially burning their cash) which made up a huge percentage of their expenses in the short term.Practically sacrificing CASH for customer loyalty. It was an edgy but risky move. It wasn’t a no brainer that they missed their recent earnings report by a small percentage. This is their game plan. Hood’s expectation is that… customers are more likely to invest with that said capital once they see it. ALSO… since the promotion is about to end, (I think it has already) their upcoming earnings report will beat expectations by a TON. If not, definitely the next one. Due to saved expenses. Compared to Coinbase, Robinhood is the jack of all trades where young investors will have an entry to learn how to invest. People believe that $hood is undervalued, but I confidently say it is still super undervalued. Keep in mind. Coinbase is 300+ in shares price because they withhold 50 BILLION plus of crypto equity. 

Funny thing is that.. I was using Charles Schwab the other day and it was fucking hard to find my entry cost. Their mobile UI is terrible to say the least. Spent 5-7 minutes tapping buttons and I STILL couldn’t find my cost.

Another thing. Their recent acquisition of TradePMR- wealth management corp. This move will essentially set their ground footing towards a banking industry.. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were to acquired SOFI. Adding in Futures + Index and the desktop app that they’ve recently released, would be another reason and THE pinnacle of their success. In the future $hood will be a Bank. 

All in all… I believe $hood will shoot up to $100 very easily. In the next 4-5 years  $250+. Mark my words. ",wallstreetbets
1732085375.0,I have taken a bearish position on ASML,"ASML had a brief relief rally on 14th November, 2024 (on the day of Investors meet) and the stocm moved upto 670 € (above its 50 days moving average). Despite very positive outlook by the company's management on the semi conductor industrt and future prospects of ASML, the rally was very short lived and the very next day (15th November, 2024) the stock plummeted to 630 € confirming the bearish trend.

The stock since then has hovered between 618-636 € range. 

The stock is repeatedly testing psychological support at 618 €. 

The next support level is at 565 €. 

I have bought PUTs at 600€ strike and 20th December expiry.

*******
A small write up on the company:

ASML is the Dutch manufacturer of advanced semiconductor equipments and lithographic machines.

They have the EUV [Extreme Ultra Voilet] technology to produce machines to craft 5 nm and smaller size chips. These are the latest AI chips used for very high performance tasks like training LLM models etc.

Nvidia and other foundaries (TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix) depend on ASML machines.

But their workhorse is DUV [Deep Ultra Voilet] technology which is used for manufacturing non AI chips and far exceed requirements in form of less intensive but more utilitarian forms like house hold appliances, cars, home laptops, computers etc.

Chinese have developed/acquired DUV technology and are able to produce upto 7 nm chips at a fraction of the cast. DUV machine may be used to produce 5 nm chips but it will lack density and in computing power. Some unconfirmed reports have stated that Chinese have made significant progress in EUV technology but we are yet to see an actual proof of that. 

US govt have put restrictions on US, EU, Korea and Taiwan based chip manufacuturers to provide latest AI chips or manchines to manufacture latest AI chips.",wallstreetbets

A couple weeks ago [I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ghf3gq/shakeschangecup/) of how I had started trading in July of this year with $10k.

In about 90 days I was able to get up to $15k and I cashed out my earnings bringing me back to $10k.

At this same time I discovered options \*cue people screaming and jumping out fire escapes\*. I failed miserabley losing 75% of my portfolio in a week. I know, I know.

I didn’t give up. Nov 4 I was just barely above $2k and I told myself I’d climb out the hole no matter what.

I’m glad to say that just about 2 weeks later I’M BACK TO $10K!!!!!

How did I do it? I looked back at my strategies and figured out what was working vs. what went wrong and decided to revert to my original strategy and it worked! My girlfriend is no longer giving me the side eye!

Big shout outs to Blackrock (again, I know), MSTR, and TSLA among many others for getting me back to my starting point.

What I learned? believe in yourself first and foremost, and don’t give up

Options trading suggests that NVIDIA's earnings announcement on Wednesday will be the most important catalyst of the year - even more important than the Federal Reserve's December meeting, Barclays strategists said. Shares of the chipmaker, which is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom, rose 4.9 per cent, leading the Standard & Poor's 500 Index higher. Earlier stock market declines were driven by Ukraine's first U.S. missile launch into Russia and President Vladimir Putin's approval of an updated nuclear strategy

For Gaurav Mallik of Pallas Capital Advisors, geopolitical uncertainty did contribute to the volatility. As for Nvidia's results, he expects them to be strong, citing capital spending by big tech companies and what he sees as ‘no obvious alternatives’ to the company's chips

1732048483.0,Let it $SNOW,"Let's face it, $SNOW has been one of the most disappointing-performing stocks of the year. While $NVDA is riding the AI wave, and $MSTR is riding the BTC boom, $SNOW has been sitting here like a fat child eating cake and shitting himself in the process.

But this is all about to change, and let's discuss why:

1. Winter is coming, and people will associate $SNOW with warm fuzzy feelings while drinking hot cocoa by the fireplace. This is inherently bullish.
2. $SNOW has historically always beaten revenue estimates (bullish), and 88% of the time it beats EPS estimates. I expect this time to be no different (beat both revenue and EPS), however this is never enough to rally this stock (more below).
3. $SNOW has been hiring like crazy. I know because I've applied twice so far and been rejected both times (smart choice on their part - bullish), which means they're being picky and likely receiving a lot of strong candidates to improve their offering (extra bullish). I've been keeping an eye on all open positions, along with how long they're open for, and new ones that pop up. Everything I've seen indicates a hiring frenzy to expand into more markets, take on new clients, etc.
4. $SNOW tends to retain their customers and strengthen existing relationships. Just today they announced a stronger partnership with $MSFT by releasing a new platform to work with $MSFT Power Platform (bullish AF)
5. In May, $SNOW appointed Sridhar Ramaswamy as the new CEO, who is expected to focus on enhancing the company's AI (bullish) product strategy.
6. Going off the point above, the actual real-world numbers of customers using their AI product is genuinely exploding, and we all know how bullish AI is in today's market. 

**Q**: Ok, but why is THIS time different than all the other earnings reports when $SNOW crashed and burned?

**A**: Like I said in Point 2 above, we Snowflakians always beat revenue and EPS predictions, but for some reason the stock always goes down. The reason behind this - as is the consensus of analysts - is that investors are cautious against how much money $SNOW is pouring into their products, R&D, and operating costs. This quarter we should start to actually see the results of these investments, returning strong usage statistics and a healthy increase in overall adoption from the industry.

**Q**: Ok, but what about, like, Databricks and stuff?

**A**: Databricks can suck my nuts (they also haven't hired me yet - I'm trying to get in before they go public for those sweet stock gainz)

It is coming, the beast rises, clawing through Fibonacci spirals and fractal patterns of CHAOS! Revelation screams it; the Nasdaq wails it; even Jim Cramer denies it, which CONFIRMS IT!

You think the SPY is a chart? NO, IT IS A GRIMOIRE! A BOOK OF SPELLS written by the sorcerers of finance—BlackRock, Vanguard, the secret Council of Five hidden beneath the Denver Airport! 666 isn’t just a *number*, it’s the KEYSTONE, the LODESTAR, the PIVOT POINT where everything COLLAPSES! The stonks will BURN, the calls will CRY OUT, and the puts will REJOICE!

Do you see the signs? THE *SIGNS!* The inflation numbers—FAKE! The GDP growth—FAKE! It’s all the Ouroboros, the snake eating itself while the Fed pumps liquidity into its veins like a HEROIN JUNKIE! The algorithms, the algos! They’re *alive,* whispering to each other in code only the quantum computers can understand. They are laughing, laughing, LAUGHING at YOU as you *buy the dip*! BUT THE DIP IS THE PIT! THE PIT OF FIRE!

You can’t escape the patterns! The charts—they’re PAREIDOLIA! Head and shoulders? NO, it’s the Leviathan! The cup and handle? NO, it’s the goblet of Babylon, filled with the blood of the retail traders! HEDGE YOUR SOULS, for the margin calls are at HAND!

Still doubt me? Let me tell you how I *know*! I SCRIED IT in the entrails of the market itself—AND CHICKENS, LITERALLY! I performed a sacred Monte Carlo analysis on the entrails of a statistically significant *sample size* of chickens, layering their fibrous patterns over a Heiken Ashi chart. The gizzard curled into a perfect ascending triangle, which broke upward into a dark cloud cover candlestick at exactly 666. The correlation coefficient? R² = 0.99! This is SCIENCE, PEOPLE!

Oh, I hear the skeptics. “666? But the SPY is at 590-something, surely it won’t—” FOOLS! It *must*! The prophecy cannot be denied! The ETFs are sacrifices on the altar of Mammon! The bonds are the seals, and when the seventh seal is broken, THEN COLLAPSE! MAYBE UP TO 15% BEFORE ROCKETING AGAIN

AND NOW, the key! The plan! The *divine hedge*! BEHOLD, I have taken positions to PROFIT FROM THE FALL OF THE BEAST! **SPY PUT OPTIONS**:

* **$565 strike, expiring 11/25/2024**
* **$550 strike, expiring 12/5/2024**
* **$400 strike, expiring 12/9/2024**

1732216671.0,Why I am bullish on SMCI. #Calls ,"SMCI has been on a roller coaster this year but personally I think this one is set to be one of the greatest comebacks we have witnessed in a while.

Reasons why I am bullish on SMCI.

1. The company has launched next-generation products utilizing NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs and CPUs, which are expected to drive demand from AI and cloud service providers. Early testing has been promising, and production is ramping up
2. SMCI remains a key supplier for AI servers and infrastructure, benefiting from the explosive growth of AI and data center investments by major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Its servers, including liquid-cooled models, are crucial for high-efficiency AI applications
3. Despite recent challenges (which many other companies have went through may I add), SMCI's underlying business remains solid. Demand for its products is robust, driven by the need for scalable, energy-efficient server solutions in AI and cloud applications. SMCI has made significant progress toward regulatory compliance, including hiring BDO USA as its auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq to avoid delisting.
4. Recent insider purchases totaling 1.51 million shares indicate confidence in the company’s future prospects. Insider buying is often viewed as a positive signal regarding management's belief in the company’s growth potential and frankly my belief as well.
5. The company’s partnership with leading firms in AI and cloud services ensures a steady demand pipeline. Expanding client adoption of its innovative server solutions further strengthens its market position.

Personally I am extremely bullish. 1.51M shares bought is absolutely mind blowing they must know something retail doesn't and the stock is trading at a huge discount right now.

Calls it is.

1732215085.0,Bear Case for Skechers ($SKX): Trump Tariffs Are Gonna Wreck 'Em ?🚨👟,"Alright, let’s break this down: Skechers is in **deep trouble** if Trump pulls the trigger on those **60-100% tariffs on Chinese imports**, and here’s why I’m betting they get smacked hard.

# The Core Problem: They’re Married to China

* **85% of Skechers’ stuff is made in China.** Let that sink in. They’re *fully dependent* on Chinese manufacturing, so these tariffs will blow a hole in their margins. they own 0 manufacturing facilities, they only have partnerships. You can imply that because of this, the stock price is mostly based on the brand value (intangible assets) and less on fixed assets.
* If costs go up, they’ll have no choice but to **jack up prices on sneakers**, which kills their whole differentiation strategy of being the affordable sneaker brand. People buy Skechers ‘cause they’re cheap, not for style or tech. Higher prices = sales tank.
* They don’t have any factories in the U.S., so moving production isn’t even an option. **Best case?** They relocate to Vietnam or wherever (which they already have about 10-15% there), but even then they’re still eating **10% tariffs**. 

# Legal and Relocation Headaches

* If Skechers tries to bail on their Chinese suppliers, they’re looking at **lawsuits for breaking contracts.** That’s just more costs piling up.
* Moving supply chains isn’t like flipping a switch. It’s expensive, takes forever, and the tariffs hit *right now.*

# China’s Gonna Clap Back

* Skechers makes a ton of money selling in China, but demand there is already slipping (you can verify their latest financial statements). Now imagine China retaliates against U.S. brands with **their own tariffs/restrictions.** Skechers gets hit on *both sides*—higher costs on imports to the U.S. and reduced sales in China. Double whammy.
* Let’s be real, Chinese consumers aren’t gonna rally behind Skechers. They’ve got plenty of local options.

# Skechers Knows They’re Screwed

* Read their financials. They’ve been **warning about this exact scenario** for years in the risks section. They know they’re exposed, but there’s nothing they can do fast enough to avoid the pain.

# TL;DR: Skechers is Toast 🍞

* **Higher costs? Check.**
* **Weaker sales in the U.S. and China? Check.**
* **Legal headaches and no easy solutions? Check.** This is shaping up to be a dumpster fire for Skechers, and I’m strapped in with puts to watch it burn.

# My Positions 💰:

* **Jan 17 $55 Puts**
* **April 17 $45 Puts**
* **June 20 $40 Puts**

Timing these across different months to ride the wave as the tariff drama unfolds. 

This is NOT a financial advice, do your own due diligence. it's not that complicated.

1732213579.0,My Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance.

On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

Positions: GOOG: 6 shares OPRA: 100 shares

Summary:

Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) has recently faced significant selling pressure, leading to a 27.9% decline over the past four weeks. However, this downturn has pushed the stock into oversold territory, indicating a potential rebound.

**Key Factors Suggesting a Rebound:**

1. **Oversold Condition:** The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 23.42 suggests that the selling pressure may be waning, setting the stage for a potential price reversal.
2. **Upward Earnings Revisions:** Wall Street analysts have raised their earnings estimates for RLAY, signaling increased optimism about the company's future performance.
3. **Strong Zacks Rank:** RLAY's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates strong near-term price appreciation potential.

2) The DOGE ""free app"" nonsense doesn't matter, but what does matter is DOGE's desire to simplify the tax code. This will affect the landscape of the tax prep software marketplace (by how much? Doesn't really matter, opens the door for more competition though)

3) Simplifying the tax code will mean that their biggest consumer segments (self-employed / small business) will need less of their services

4) The above is assuming there is no app. If there is... Don't you think the man who led the charge on **Paypal** can spearhead the improvement of existing government tax preparation apps (or develop new ones?)

Moving on. Why is Dutch-based $ASML down given their monopoly on lithography machines? NVDA, for instance, cannot grow without them. You need their gear to make AI chips and stuff. They legit own this space with the closest competitor being Cannon (yes, the camera company) which is a far cry from where $ASML is with its lithography equipment. 

$ASML profit margins are typically about 50%. In the third quarter (Oct. 15), revenue was €7.5B in sales with ~51% profit. The CEO said there’s been a slowdown in some areas like “memory” (I honestly don’t know what that means) and projects 2025 revenue to be €30-€35B (€28B is projected for calendar year 2024). 

This stock hit nearly $1,100 about six months ago. It’s down to ~$650. Their lithography equipment is required for AI. 

If you’re betting on AI then how can you not bet on this company which serves as the only pick and shovel in town? 

I don’t own any shares and I am not a savvy stock person. I just buy shares like an idiot. But this community sometimes has great advice that’s made me wild gains.

I am long this synthetic long position at a 10-3 ratio, meaning I am long 10 calls for each 3 short puts which I sold to finance the position. I am still at net debit, but much smaller if I just bought OTM calls.

The long calls are lottos which may or may not explode, but the short $4 puts are giving me long and sideways exposure to profit, as long as the stock is higher than $3.4. I picked this put strike because the insiders kept buying at these levels and there is margin of safety in the trade.

Good luck, trade small, and trade carefully.

If you want to read the background on how insiders can show you when and how to double your money, see the original post and my follow up posts and trades. Here is a brief summary of my posts and trades:

1. VSTS - OG post, [posted on 5/10/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1coug3v/informed_traders_can_show_you_how_and_when_to/), stock was up a max 50% from the date
2. ATEC - [posted on 8/27/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f2qm8i/informed_traders_can_show_you_when_to_double_your/) the stock is now up 50% from the post date
3. PBF - [posted on 9/4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f92x8n/pbf_insiders_can_show_you_when_and_how_to_double/),  the stock is now down 5% form the post date

Interestingly, I made most money on PBF because I sold puts to recover the cost of the vertical spread, and I am still short $30 December puts. I made good money on ATEC even though my duration was short, and I barely made any money on the first trade on VSTS because it was a complex spread which did not work with the slow rise. This is just FIY on how you can use options but still make money in a sideways market, or lose money even if you pick the right direction, but you are wrong on duration.",wallstreetbets

1732186470.0,Why Nvidia may not follow the same fate as Cisco ,"The Financial  times Lex with some fun facts on NVIDIA stock market dominance and what is much different about it compared to former market darling Cisco Nvidia’s fortunes increasingly drive everyone else’s. 

At $3.6tn, the company is the world’s biggest by market capitalisation, and makes up **7️⃣**% of the S&P 500 index. Back in 2000 when Cisco briefly became the planet’s most valuable company, its weighting was less than **4️⃣**% of the S&P. 

As of Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock accounts for **2️⃣4️⃣**% of the index’s gains this year.

The result is that when Nvidia does well, animal spirits 🦍 rise across the market. Bank of America analysts had calculated this week that investors were expecting a **1% index move** in response to Nvidia’s earnings — greater than the shift they expect from US inflation data later this month.

 In the short term, Nvidia has the enviable benefits of both scale and scarcity. 

Supply constraints keep prices high, and the company says demand for its new Blackwell chips will exceed its expectations of 'several billion dollars' in the current quarter. 

💸 Meanwhile, governments from Saudi Arabia to Denmark are seeking to build their own state-backed artificial intelligence initiatives, so while Silicon Valley depends on Nvidia, the reverse is becoming less true.

 That suggests the virtuous circle can continue. Whether that justifies a valuation of **3️⃣4️⃣** times forward earnings is up for grabs. Cisco stock, after a moment on top of the world, plunged during the dotcom crash, and never recovered.

 While Nvidia’s customers are paying hand over fist for chips driven by the promise of AI, it remains to be seen whether their customers — and their customers’ customers — will pay up for the resulting services too.💡

Nvidia has two things in its favour. First, its valuation is far behind the **1️⃣3️⃣0️⃣** times earnings Cisco enjoyed in 2000. Second, Huang has the benefit of hindsight and lavish profitability. Cisco’s earnings were **2️⃣0️⃣**% of its sales before the dotcom crash; Nvidia’s are nearly **6️⃣0️⃣**%.

 Spend that wisely, and his company will move the market for some time to come.""(+++Opinions are my own. Not investment advice. Do your own research.+++)",wallstreetbets

1732129689.0,$RIVN: Riding to Valhalla,"Alright, degenerates. Rivian isn’t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore—it’s the ex-nerd who’s going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you’re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.

## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver

**Tesla’s Fumbling the Ball** 

Elon’s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they’re turning the corner to RIVN, who’s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla’s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian’s already at brunch ordering mimosas.

**How Rivian Could Ride Trump’s EV Rollercoaster**

You’d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here’s the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely “America First” policies. With Rivian’s production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump’s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian’s set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone’s FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it’s only a matter of time until the market realizes this.

**New Models That’ll Make You Feel Things** 

Let’s talk about Rivian’s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it’s the hot-but-affordable option that’s ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla’s Supercharger network? That’s not just sexy—that’s full-blown EV porn. This isn’t a one-night stand; Rivian’s building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn’t inclusive enough for you Wendy’s employees, they’re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).

**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** 

Sure, Rivian’s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they’ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they’ve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That’s efficiency, baby.

**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**

 Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They’re hyped about Rivian’s leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.

RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they’re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company’s market cap isn’t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they’re only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian’s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW’s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian’s like the guy spending money he doesn’t have to impress his date. Sure, it’s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it’s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he’s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that’s all he talks about? Hell no, he’ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn’t just another EV play—it’s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian’s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock’s the real deal, and I’m strapping in for the ride.

1732114947.0,$ACHR The Bull Run Hasn't Started Yet," **TLDR:** Current fair value is +$10imo, Archer is currently the leader and will likely be the first to market, Major upcoming catalysts: Factory opening by the end of next month, Initiation of manufacturing in Jan, Final FAA certification, and Trump Presidency.

 Archer Aviation ($ACHR) recently delivered a strong Q3 earnings call, highlighting significant advancements in their journey to commercialize eVTOL technology. With robust financials, strategic partnerships, New Trump Administration, and progress in FAA certification, Archer is positioning itself to outpace competitors and become the first to market in the eVTOL industry. 

# Archer Will Likely Be The First To Market

Archer Aviation ($ACHR) is likely to be the **first to market** in the eVTOL industry, even outpacing Joby Aviation. How? Their focus on **scalability and an efficient supply chain** sets them apart. They've strategically outsourced about **80% of their major components** to established **Tier 1 suppliers** who have FAA certification expertise. This traditional aerospace model **reduces development risks, speeds up the certification process, and taps into existing supply chains for faster scalability.** Basically, they're not trying to reinvent the wheel, and it's paying off big time. This approach reduces development risks, speeds up the certification process, and utilizes existing supply chains for faster scalability.

In contrast, Joby follows a vertically integrated model, designing and manufacturing most components in-house, which allows for greater control and potentially higher performance but involves higher capital costs, longer certification timelines, and scaling challenges due to the novelty of its components. This difference in strategy positions Archer for a quicker and more efficient path to market.

As **Archer tweeted on Friday**, Archer's type-design is now **matured**, and they're ready to start producing piloted aircraft as soon as their **factory opens** at the **end of this year.** These aircraft will be operational by the beginning of 2025, with plans for piloted demonstrations and market survey flights with passengers throughout the year.

# Trumps Interest in VTOLs and The New Secretary of Transportation

President Donald Trump recently announced his administration’s support for VTOL technology, recognizing its transformative potential for economic growth and national security. Adding to this momentum, among Trump's picks for Secretary of Transportation is **Emil Michael**. If appointed, he has close ties to **Archer’s Chief Commercial Officer, Nihil Goel as he tweeted on Saturday.** This relationship could facilitate smoother regulatory pathways for Archer as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) finalizes critical rules for advanced air mobility. With the **new Trump administration,** Archer is poised to **benefit** from from significant political and regulatory tailwinds that could accelerate its growth in a market projected to reach **$1 trillion by 2040**.

# Financially Strong As Mentioned in Q3 Call

As mentioned in their Q3 call, Archer ended the quarter with over **$500 million** in cash reserves(with an additional 400M unaccounted for). With a quarterly cash burn of about **$80-90 million**, this gives them a solid **18-month runway**. This strong cash position is further **strengthened** by their partnership with **Stellantis**, which has agreed to contribute up to **$400 million** to help scale the manufacturing of Archer's Midnight aircraft. This capital **will cover manufacturing labor costs and capital expenditures for initial production at their new facility in Georgia.** By outsourcing 80% of their components to established suppliers, they've managed to keep operational costs in check while accelerating production timelines.

Additionally, Archer has issued **$30 million** in performance warrants to Stellantis, which will vest upon achieving certain milestones. They also have contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense worth up to **$148 million**.

# AHCR Fair valuation +$10

 After their Q3 earnings call, Archer received many analyst upgrades ranging between $10-12 PT. While Archer is ahead of JOBY in my opinion and will enter the market first, currently there's such a significant difference in market caps between Archer and Joby.

Joby is trading at **$6.14** with a market cap of **$4.72 billion**, while **Archer Aviation (ACHR)** is at **$5.00** with a market cap of only **$2.15 billion**. If we compare apples to apples, Archer should be valued potentially around **$12**. In fact, Archer is ahead imo due to its scalability, reliance on established parts suppliers, and lower costs. Their strategy will speeds up the FAA certification process and allows for quicker scalability. On the other hand, Joby's vertically integrated model, while offering more control, comes with higher capital costs, longer certification timelines, and scaling challenges. This difference in approach positions Archer for a faster and more efficient path to market, making the current valuation gap seem unjustified.

1732112527.0,Ford to make massive job cuts in Europe due to EV transition and increased competition,"Ford Motor ( F ) said on Wednesday it would cut about 14 per cent of its European workforce, citing significant losses suffered by the company in recent years, combined with weak demand for electric vehicles, a lack of government support for the transition to electric vehicles and increased competition.

The U.S. company is the latest automaker to cut costs, following Nissan, Stellantis and General Motors, as the industry faces challenges from growing competition from European Chinese rivals, waning demand in China and a shift to electric vehicles that are out of reach for most consumers.

Ford said the 4,000 job cuts were mainly in Germany and Britain. Globally, the job cuts represent about 2.3 per cent of Ford's 174,000 employees.

The moves will hit especially hard in Germany, Europe's largest economy and biggest carmaker, where Volkswagen has threatened to close factories, slash wages and cut thousands of jobs to improve its competitiveness.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-cut-14-european-jobs-133149441.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-cut-14-european-jobs-133149441.html)",wallstreetbets

According to the current speculation, Nvidia's third-quarter revenue (EPS) is expected to be $0.74 for $33.2 billion, up 83% year-over-year, respectively. Of this, revenue from the data centre division is expected to reach $29 billion, an increase of 100% from the same period last year. Gaming Revenue



Investors are not only focusing on the financial performance of the third quarter, but also on whether Nvidia will adjust its earnings estimates for the fourth quarter. Analysts are still predicting $37 billion for the fourth quarter. However, even if the earnings report exceeds expectations, Nvidia's stock will still hit $37 billion. The possible decline could be partly due to the market its earnings expectations have trended higher, or investors



Also, Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI chips are expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue for the company, but shipments of the series have been delayed, mainly due to overheating issues affecting servers, which may be its installations in data centres. , the current government department may impose tariffs on global products, especially on chips made in Taiwan, giving Nvidia levy uncertainty. Since most of Nvidia's chips are made by Taiwan's TSMC, the tariffs could raise the price of AI chips, which could affect its profit margins or pass the cost on to customers.



These signs could lead to a less-than-expected market reaction. It could create uncertainty for Nvidia's future. Do you think these potential risks will affect Nvidia's long-term growth?

1732217540.0,An argument for why SPY will peak at 666 within the next 3 months,"After looking at some pretty significant patterns in the recent SPY charts, I have reason to believe that there is still significant room to run, most likely as high as $666 before the inevitable correction, which I believe will trigger a recession. Obviously this is not financial advice, please do your own research and due diligence.   
  
 LISTEN! LISTEN, oh ye with wallets fat and hearts empty, for I have SEEN the truth, the numbers, the DIVINE resonance! 666! SIX-SIX-SIX! It is coming, the beast rises, clawing through Fibonacci spirals and fractal patterns of CHAOS! Revelation screams it; the Nasdaq wails it; even Jim Cramer denies it, which CONFIRMS IT!

You think the SPY is a chart? NO, IT IS A GRIMOIRE! A BOOK OF SPELLS written by the sorcerers of finance—BlackRock, Vanguard, the secret Council of Five hidden beneath the Denver Airport! 666 isn’t just a *number*, it’s the KEYSTONE, the LODESTAR, the PIVOT POINT where everything COLLAPSES! The stonks will BURN, the calls will CRY OUT, and the puts will REJOICE!

Do you see the signs? THE *SIGNS!* The inflation numbers—FAKE! The GDP growth—FAKE! It’s all the Ouroboros, the snake eating itself while the Fed pumps liquidity into its veins like a HEROIN JUNKIE! The algorithms, the algos! They’re *alive,* whispering to each other in code only the quantum computers can understand. They are laughing, laughing, LAUGHING at YOU as you *buy the dip*! BUT THE DIP IS THE PIT! THE PIT OF FIRE!

You can’t escape the patterns! The charts—they’re PAREIDOLIA! Head and shoulders? NO, it’s the Leviathan! The cup and handle? NO, it’s the goblet of Babylon, filled with the blood of the retail traders! HEDGE YOUR SOULS, for the margin calls are at HAND!

Still doubt me? Let me tell you how I *know*! I SCRIED IT in the entrails of the market itself—AND CHICKENS, LITERALLY! I performed a sacred Monte Carlo analysis on the entrails of a statistically significant *sample size* of chickens, layering their fibrous patterns over a Heiken Ashi chart. The gizzard curled into a perfect ascending triangle, which broke upward into a dark cloud cover candlestick at exactly 666. The correlation coefficient? R² = 0.99! This is SCIENCE, PEOPLE!

Oh, I hear the skeptics. “666? But the SPY is at 590-something, surely it won’t—” FOOLS! It *must*! The prophecy cannot be denied! The ETFs are sacrifices on the altar of Mammon! The bonds are the seals, and when the seventh seal is broken, THEN COLLAPSE! MAYBE UP TO 15% BEFORE ROCKETING AGAIN

AND NOW, the key! The plan! The *divine hedge*! BEHOLD, I have taken positions to PROFIT FROM THE FALL OF THE BEAST! **SPY PUT OPTIONS**:

* **$565 strike, expiring 11/25/2024**
* **$550 strike, expiring 12/5/2024**
* **$400 strike, expiring 12/9/2024**

1732216671.0,Why I am bullish on SMCI. #Calls ,"SMCI has been on a roller coaster this year but personally I think this one is set to be one of the greatest comebacks we have witnessed in a while.

Reasons why I am bullish on SMCI.

1. The company has launched next-generation products utilizing NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs and CPUs, which are expected to drive demand from AI and cloud service providers. Early testing has been promising, and production is ramping up
2. SMCI remains a key supplier for AI servers and infrastructure, benefiting from the explosive growth of AI and data center investments by major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Its servers, including liquid-cooled models, are crucial for high-efficiency AI applications
3. Despite recent challenges (which many other companies have went through may I add), SMCI's underlying business remains solid. Demand for its products is robust, driven by the need for scalable, energy-efficient server solutions in AI and cloud applications. SMCI has made significant progress toward regulatory compliance, including hiring BDO USA as its auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq to avoid delisting.
4. Recent insider purchases totaling 1.51 million shares indicate confidence in the company’s future prospects. Insider buying is often viewed as a positive signal regarding management's belief in the company’s growth potential and frankly my belief as well.
5. The company’s partnership with leading firms in AI and cloud services ensures a steady demand pipeline. Expanding client adoption of its innovative server solutions further strengthens its market position.

Personally I am extremely bullish. 1.51M shares bought is absolutely mind blowing they must know something retail doesn't and the stock is trading at a huge discount right now.

Calls it is.

1732215085.0,Bear Case for Skechers ($SKX): Trump Tariffs Are Gonna Wreck 'Em ?🚨👟,"Alright, let’s break this down: Skechers is in **deep trouble** if Trump pulls the trigger on those **60-100% tariffs on Chinese imports**, and here’s why I’m betting they get smacked hard.

# The Core Problem: They’re Married to China

* **85% of Skechers’ stuff is made in China.** Let that sink in. They’re *fully dependent* on Chinese manufacturing, so these tariffs will blow a hole in their margins. they own 0 manufacturing facilities, they only have partnerships. You can imply that because of this, the stock price is mostly based on the brand value (intangible assets) and less on fixed assets.
* If costs go up, they’ll have no choice but to **jack up prices on sneakers**, which kills their whole differentiation strategy of being the affordable sneaker brand. People buy Skechers ‘cause they’re cheap, not for style or tech. Higher prices = sales tank.
* They don’t have any factories in the U.S., so moving production isn’t even an option. **Best case?** They relocate to Vietnam or wherever (which they already have about 10-15% there), but even then they’re still eating **10% tariffs**. 

# Legal and Relocation Headaches

* If Skechers tries to bail on their Chinese suppliers, they’re looking at **lawsuits for breaking contracts.** That’s just more costs piling up.
* Moving supply chains isn’t like flipping a switch. It’s expensive, takes forever, and the tariffs hit *right now.*

# China’s Gonna Clap Back

* Skechers makes a ton of money selling in China, but demand there is already slipping (you can verify their latest financial statements). Now imagine China retaliates against U.S. brands with **their own tariffs/restrictions.** Skechers gets hit on *both sides*—higher costs on imports to the U.S. and reduced sales in China. Double whammy.
* Let’s be real, Chinese consumers aren’t gonna rally behind Skechers. They’ve got plenty of local options.

# Skechers Knows They’re Screwed

* Read their financials. They’ve been **warning about this exact scenario** for years in the risks section. They know they’re exposed, but there’s nothing they can do fast enough to avoid the pain.

# TL;DR: Skechers is Toast 🍞

* **Higher costs? Check.**
* **Weaker sales in the U.S. and China? Check.**
* **Legal headaches and no easy solutions? Check.** This is shaping up to be a dumpster fire for Skechers, and I’m strapped in with puts to watch it burn.

# My Positions 💰:

* **Jan 17 $55 Puts**
* **April 17 $45 Puts**
* **June 20 $40 Puts**

Timing these across different months to ride the wave as the tariff drama unfolds. 

This is NOT a financial advice, do your own due diligence. it's not that complicated.

1732213579.0,My Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance.

On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

Positions: GOOG: 6 shares OPRA: 100 shares

   * YouTube's ad and subscription revenue surpassed $50 billion over the past four quarters.

**Growth Drivers Moving Forward:**

* Ad revenues: October (presidential ads), Black Friday, Christmas, and New Year campaigns.
* YouTube: Big creators like Cristiano Ronaldo and MrBeast remain highly active.
* Waymo: Successful expansion across multiple cities.

Summary:

Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) has recently faced significant selling pressure, leading to a 27.9% decline over the past four weeks. However, this downturn has pushed the stock into oversold territory, indicating a potential rebound.

**Key Factors Suggesting a Rebound:**

1. **Oversold Condition:** The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 23.42 suggests that the selling pressure may be waning, setting the stage for a potential price reversal.
2. **Upward Earnings Revisions:** Wall Street analysts have raised their earnings estimates for RLAY, signaling increased optimism about the company's future performance.
3. **Strong Zacks Rank:** RLAY's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates strong near-term price appreciation potential.

2) The DOGE ""free app"" nonsense doesn't matter, but what does matter is DOGE's desire to simplify the tax code. This will affect the landscape of the tax prep software marketplace (by how much? Doesn't really matter, opens the door for more competition though)

3) Simplifying the tax code will mean that their biggest consumer segments (self-employed / small business) will need less of their services

4) The above is assuming there is no app. If there is... Don't you think the man who led the charge on **Paypal** can spearhead the improvement of existing government tax preparation apps (or develop new ones?)

The call will be interesting. My prediction : Slight earnings miss OR barely beat (same thing to investors) with guidance that doesn't encourage - **INTU 630 at postmarket**

Moving on. Why is Dutch-based $ASML down given their monopoly on lithography machines? NVDA, for instance, cannot grow without them. You need their gear to make AI chips and stuff. They legit own this space with the closest competitor being Cannon (yes, the camera company) which is a far cry from where $ASML is with its lithography equipment. 

$ASML profit margins are typically about 50%. In the third quarter (Oct. 15), revenue was €7.5B in sales with ~51% profit. The CEO said there’s been a slowdown in some areas like “memory” (I honestly don’t know what that means) and projects 2025 revenue to be €30-€35B (€28B is projected for calendar year 2024). 

This stock hit nearly $1,100 about six months ago. It’s down to ~$650. Their lithography equipment is required for AI. 

If you’re betting on AI then how can you not bet on this company which serves as the only pick and shovel in town? 

I don’t own any shares and I am not a savvy stock person. I just buy shares like an idiot. But this community sometimes has great advice that’s made me wild gains.

I am long this synthetic long position at a 10-3 ratio, meaning I am long 10 calls for each 3 short puts which I sold to finance the position. I am still at net debit, but much smaller if I just bought OTM calls.

The long calls are lottos which may or may not explode, but the short $4 puts are giving me long and sideways exposure to profit, as long as the stock is higher than $3.4. I picked this put strike because the insiders kept buying at these levels and there is margin of safety in the trade.

Good luck, trade small, and trade carefully.

If you want to read the background on how insiders can show you when and how to double your money, see the original post and my follow up posts and trades. Here is a brief summary of my posts and trades:

1. VSTS - OG post, [posted on 5/10/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1coug3v/informed_traders_can_show_you_how_and_when_to/), stock was up a max 50% from the date
2. ATEC - [posted on 8/27/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f2qm8i/informed_traders_can_show_you_when_to_double_your/) the stock is now up 50% from the post date
3. PBF - [posted on 9/4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f92x8n/pbf_insiders_can_show_you_when_and_how_to_double/),  the stock is now down 5% form the post date

Interestingly, I made most money on PBF because I sold puts to recover the cost of the vertical spread, and I am still short $30 December puts. I made good money on ATEC even though my duration was short, and I barely made any money on the first trade on VSTS because it was a complex spread which did not work with the slow rise.

1732186470.0,Why Nvidia may not follow the same fate as Cisco ,"The Financial  times Lex with some fun facts on NVIDIA stock market dominance and what is much different about it compared to former market darling Cisco Nvidia’s fortunes increasingly drive everyone else’s. 

At $3.6tn, the company is the world’s biggest by market capitalisation, and makes up **7️⃣**% of the S&P 500 index. Back in 2000 when Cisco briefly became the planet’s most valuable company, its weighting was less than **4️⃣**% of the S&P. 

As of Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock accounts for **2️⃣4️⃣**% of the index’s gains this year.

The result is that when Nvidia does well, animal spirits 🦍 rise across the market. Bank of America analysts had calculated this week that investors were expecting a **1% index move** in response to Nvidia’s earnings — greater than the shift they expect from US inflation data later this month.

 In the short term, Nvidia has the enviable benefits of both scale and scarcity. 

Supply constraints keep prices high, and the company says demand for its new Blackwell chips will exceed its expectations of 'several billion dollars' in the current quarter. 

💸 Meanwhile, governments from Saudi Arabia to Denmark are seeking to build their own state-backed artificial intelligence initiatives, so while Silicon Valley depends on Nvidia, the reverse is becoming less true.

 That suggests the virtuous circle can continue. Whether that justifies a valuation of **3️⃣4️⃣** times forward earnings is up for grabs. Cisco stock, after a moment on top of the world, plunged during the dotcom crash, and never recovered.

 While Nvidia’s customers are paying hand over fist for chips driven by the promise of AI, it remains to be seen whether their customers — and their customers’ customers — will pay up for the resulting services too.💡

Nvidia has two things in its favour. First, its valuation is far behind the **1️⃣3️⃣0️⃣** times earnings Cisco enjoyed in 2000. Second, Huang has the benefit of hindsight and lavish profitability. Cisco’s earnings were **2️⃣0️⃣**% of its sales before the dotcom crash; Nvidia’s are nearly **6️⃣0️⃣**%.

1732164026.0,Starbucks Is Said to Consider Selling Stake in Chinese Business,"> Starbucks Corp. is exploring options for its Chinese operations including the possibility of selling a stake in the business, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

> The coffee chain has been speaking to advisers about ways to grow its operations in China including the potential introduction of a local partner, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. It has informally gauged interest from prospective investors, including domestic private equity firms, the people said.

> A stake sale could also attract interest from Chinese conglomerates or other local companies with experience in the industry, some of the people said. Starbucks is still evaluating its options and hasn’t made a decision about whether to proceed, the people said. 

> Starbucks has faced pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management, which wants it to commit to reviewing its Chinese business, Bloomberg News has reported. In previous years, McDonald’s Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc. have carved out their Chinese operations and sold stakes to private equity firms to tap more growth and better cater to local tastes. 

> China is the second-biggest market globally for Starbucks and generated about $3 billion of net revenue in the most recent financial year, when the company increased its store count in the country by 12%.

1732129689.0,$RIVN: Riding to Valhalla,"Alright, degenerates. Rivian isn’t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore—it’s the ex-nerd who’s going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you’re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.

## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver

**Tesla’s Fumbling the Ball** 

Elon’s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they’re turning the corner to RIVN, who’s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla’s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian’s already at brunch ordering mimosas.

**How Rivian Could Ride Trump’s EV Rollercoaster**

You’d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here’s the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely “America First” policies. With Rivian’s production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump’s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian’s set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone’s FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it’s only a matter of time until the market realizes this.

**New Models That’ll Make You Feel Things** 

Let’s talk about Rivian’s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it’s the hot-but-affordable option that’s ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla’s Supercharger network? That’s not just sexy—that’s full-blown EV porn. This isn’t a one-night stand; Rivian’s building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn’t inclusive enough for you Wendy’s employees, they’re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).

**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** 

Sure, Rivian’s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they’ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they’ve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That’s efficiency, baby.

**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**

 Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They’re hyped about Rivian’s leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.

RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they’re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company’s market cap isn’t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they’re only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.  


https://preview.redd.it/tc3jgmanu32e1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4d1888d8fc95e1f6fc9412032bb443304282aa

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian’s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW’s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian’s like the guy spending money he doesn’t have to impress his date. Sure, it’s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it’s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he’s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that’s all he talks about? Hell no, he’ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn’t just another EV play—it’s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian’s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock’s the real deal, and I’m strapping in for the ride.

What will he do next? Well he will have another offering, and another, and another and use it to drive up the very asset that makes his stock climb higher.

# Cost Cutting + Turn Around Strategy

$PBI is focused on 4 strategic initiatives, the main 2 which are highlighted here:

(1) **Paying down high-cost debt**. They've already started to execute this ([News Room](https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/newsroom/press-releases.html)) resulting in over $11M in annual savings and boosting 2025 EPS by $0.06. They have a lot more room to reduce debt and are making this the top priority  
(2) **Selling off Ecommerce Segment**. The Global Ecommerce segment had been struggling to achieve profitability over the past several years in the face of macroeconomic and industry headwinds ([https://www.investorrelations.pitneybowes.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pitney-bowes-announces-value-maximizing-exit-path-global](https://www.investorrelations.pitneybowes.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pitney-bowes-announces-value-maximizing-exit-path-global)). Reducing this will help streamline costs, increase profitability, and allow for the focus on the core business

1732224550.0,Ok now share your MSTR loss porn!,"I’m regarded and can’t figure out how to show the p&l on the fidelity app but total loss was about $7k. Here’s the hilarious and regarded story to go with it 

I’m on a trip in Asia so I’m having dinner. And I have a few beers. Then I have a few more. Then I say hmm how can I fomo into MSTR safely? Ok I’ll go long 50 shares at open - nope that was a loss of $800

One more beer later - ok let’s look at the options chain. Wow these premiums are super juiced!  Why are these premiums so wildly juiced 1 day to expiration I thought (more on that later). Ok I’ll sell a faaar OTM put expiring the following day for quite a nice premium I though. Surely it can drop 100 points in a day right? And literally less than a minute after this put gets filled Citron releases their short report on Mstr and they go to have their worst day in the companies history. The most regarded part is I just watched it fall and didn’t do anything thinking nah it will bounce any minute now. Then decide to go to bed. Then middle of the night Igor realize fuck I can’t let that get assigned because the first wash will be a wash. So I open my computer at 4 am and close the position at a massive loss. This is fun!

The premiums were so juiced btw because the market knew something was going to be released today. Why else were premiums sitting at 250% IV. They haven’t been this high. Enjoy assholes!

Obviously this is not financial advice, please do your own research and due diligence.   
  
 LISTEN! LISTEN, oh ye with wallets fat and hearts empty, for I have SEEN the truth, the numbers, the DIVINE resonance! 666! SIX-SIX-SIX! It is coming, the beast rises, clawing through Fibonacci spirals and fractal patterns of CHAOS! Revelation screams it; the Nasdaq wails it; even Jim Cramer denies it, which CONFIRMS IT!

You think the SPY is a chart? NO, IT IS A GRIMOIRE! A BOOK OF SPELLS written by the sorcerers of finance—BlackRock, Vanguard, the secret Council of Five hidden beneath the Denver Airport! 666 isn’t just a *number*, it’s the KEYSTONE, the LODESTAR, the PIVOT POINT where everything COLLAPSES! The stonks will BURN, the calls will CRY OUT, and the puts will REJOICE!

Do you see the signs? THE *SIGNS!* The inflation numbers—FAKE! The GDP growth—FAKE! It’s all the Ouroboros, the snake eating itself while the Fed pumps liquidity into its veins like a HEROIN JUNKIE! The algorithms, the algos! They’re *alive,* whispering to each other in code only the quantum computers can understand. They are laughing, laughing, LAUGHING at YOU as you *buy the dip*! BUT THE DIP IS THE PIT! THE PIT OF FIRE!

You can’t escape the patterns! The charts—they’re PAREIDOLIA! Head and shoulders? NO, it’s the Leviathan! The cup and handle? NO, it’s the goblet of Babylon, filled with the blood of the retail traders! HEDGE YOUR SOULS, for the margin calls are at HAND!

Still doubt me? Let me tell you how I *know*! I SCRIED IT in the entrails of the market itself—AND CHICKENS, LITERALLY! I performed a sacred Monte Carlo analysis on the entrails of a statistically significant *sample size* of chickens, layering their fibrous patterns over a Heiken Ashi chart. The gizzard curled into a perfect ascending triangle, which broke upward into a dark cloud cover candlestick at exactly 666. The correlation coefficient? R² = 0.99! This is SCIENCE, PEOPLE!

Oh, I hear the skeptics. “666? But the SPY is at 590-something, surely it won’t—” FOOLS! It *must*! The prophecy cannot be denied! The ETFs are sacrifices on the altar of Mammon! The bonds are the seals, and when the seventh seal is broken, THEN COLLAPSE! MAYBE UP TO 15% BEFORE ROCKETING AGAIN

AND NOW, the key! The plan! The *divine hedge*! BEHOLD, I have taken positions to PROFIT FROM THE FALL OF THE BEAST! **SPY PUT OPTIONS**:

* **$565 strike, expiring 11/25/2024**
* **$550 strike, expiring 12/5/2024**
* **$400 strike, expiring 12/9/2024**

1732216671.0,Why I am bullish on SMCI. #Calls ,"SMCI has been on a roller coaster this year but personally I think this one is set to be one of the greatest comebacks we have witnessed in a while.

Reasons why I am bullish on SMCI.

1. The company has launched next-generation products utilizing NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs and CPUs, which are expected to drive demand from AI and cloud service providers. Early testing has been promising, and production is ramping up
2. SMCI remains a key supplier for AI servers and infrastructure, benefiting from the explosive growth of AI and data center investments by major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Its servers, including liquid-cooled models, are crucial for high-efficiency AI applications
3. Despite recent challenges (which many other companies have went through may I add), SMCI's underlying business remains solid. Demand for its products is robust, driven by the need for scalable, energy-efficient server solutions in AI and cloud applications. SMCI has made significant progress toward regulatory compliance, including hiring BDO USA as its auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq to avoid delisting.
4. Recent insider purchases totaling 1.51 million shares indicate confidence in the company’s future prospects. Insider buying is often viewed as a positive signal regarding management's belief in the company’s growth potential and frankly my belief as well.
5. The company’s partnership with leading firms in AI and cloud services ensures a steady demand pipeline. Expanding client adoption of its innovative server solutions further strengthens its market position.

Personally I am extremely bullish. 1.51M shares bought is absolutely mind blowing they must know something retail doesn't and the stock is trading at a huge discount right now.

Calls it is.

1732215085.0,Bear Case for Skechers ($SKX): Trump Tariffs Are Gonna Wreck 'Em ?🚨👟,"Alright, let’s break this down: Skechers is in **deep trouble** if Trump pulls the trigger on those **60-100% tariffs on Chinese imports**, and here’s why I’m betting they get smacked hard.

# The Core Problem: They’re Married to China

* **85% of Skechers’ stuff is made in China.** Let that sink in. They’re *fully dependent* on Chinese manufacturing, so these tariffs will blow a hole in their margins. they own 0 manufacturing facilities, they only have partnerships. You can imply that because of this, the stock price is mostly based on the brand value (intangible assets) and less on fixed assets.
* If costs go up, they’ll have no choice but to **jack up prices on sneakers**, which kills their whole differentiation strategy of being the affordable sneaker brand. People buy Skechers ‘cause they’re cheap, not for style or tech. Higher prices = sales tank.
* They don’t have any factories in the U.S., so moving production isn’t even an option. **Best case?** They relocate to Vietnam or wherever (which they already have about 10-15% there), but even then they’re still eating **10% tariffs**. 

# Legal and Relocation Headaches

* If Skechers tries to bail on their Chinese suppliers, they’re looking at **lawsuits for breaking contracts.** That’s just more costs piling up.
* Moving supply chains isn’t like flipping a switch. It’s expensive, takes forever, and the tariffs hit *right now.*

# China’s Gonna Clap Back

* Skechers makes a ton of money selling in China, but demand there is already slipping (you can verify their latest financial statements). Now imagine China retaliates against U.S. brands with **their own tariffs/restrictions.** Skechers gets hit on *both sides*—higher costs on imports to the U.S. and reduced sales in China. Double whammy.
* Let’s be real, Chinese consumers aren’t gonna rally behind Skechers. They’ve got plenty of local options.

# Skechers Knows They’re Screwed

* Read their financials. They’ve been **warning about this exact scenario** for years in the risks section. They know they’re exposed, but there’s nothing they can do fast enough to avoid the pain.

# TL;DR: Skechers is Toast 🍞

* **Higher costs? Check.**
* **Weaker sales in the U.S. and China? Check.**
* **Legal headaches and no easy solutions? Check.** This is shaping up to be a dumpster fire for Skechers, and I’m strapped in with puts to watch it burn.

# My Positions 💰:

* **Jan 17 $55 Puts**
* **April 17 $45 Puts**
* **June 20 $40 Puts**

Timing these across different months to ride the wave as the tariff drama unfolds. 

This is NOT a financial advice, do your own due diligence. it's not that complicated.

1732213579.0,My Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance.

On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

Positions: GOOG: 6 shares OPRA: 100 shares

      * Growth in Search and other services

   * **Google Cloud**: $11.4 billion (+35%), fueled by:

      * Higher adoption of core GCP products
* **Profitability**:
   * Operating Income: +34%, with a 4.5% margin expansion to 32%
   * Net Income: +34%; EPS rose 37% to $2.12
* **Key Highlights**:
   * CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted AI as a major growth driver.
   * YouTube's ad and subscription revenue surpassed $50 billion over the past four quarters.

**Growth Drivers Moving Forward:**

* Ad revenues: October (presidential ads), Black Friday, Christmas, and New Year campaigns.
* YouTube: Big creators like Cristiano Ronaldo and MrBeast remain highly active.
* Waymo: Successful expansion across multiple cities.
* Cloud: Continued growth in demand and usage.

Summary:

Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) has recently faced significant selling pressure, leading to a 27.9% decline over the past four weeks. However, this downturn has pushed the stock into oversold territory, indicating a potential rebound.

**Key Factors Suggesting a Rebound:**

1. **Oversold Condition:** The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 23.42 suggests that the selling pressure may be waning, setting the stage for a potential price reversal.
2. **Upward Earnings Revisions:** Wall Street analysts have raised their earnings estimates for RLAY, signaling increased optimism about the company's future performance.
3. **Strong Zacks Rank:** RLAY's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates strong near-term price appreciation potential.

2) The DOGE ""free app"" nonsense doesn't matter, but what does matter is DOGE's desire to simplify the tax code. This will affect the landscape of the tax prep software marketplace (by how much? Doesn't really matter, opens the door for more competition though)

3) Simplifying the tax code will mean that their biggest consumer segments (self-employed / small business) will need less of their services

4) The above is assuming there is no app. If there is... Don't you think the man who led the charge on **Paypal** can spearhead the improvement of existing government tax preparation apps (or develop new ones?)

The call will be interesting. My prediction : Slight earnings miss OR barely beat (same thing to investors) with guidance that doesn't encourage - **INTU 630 at postmarket**

Moving on. Why is Dutch-based $ASML down given their monopoly on lithography machines? NVDA, for instance, cannot grow without them. You need their gear to make AI chips and stuff. They legit own this space with the closest competitor being Cannon (yes, the camera company) which is a far cry from where $ASML is with its lithography equipment. 

$ASML profit margins are typically about 50%. In the third quarter (Oct. 15), revenue was €7.5B in sales with ~51% profit. The CEO said there’s been a slowdown in some areas like “memory” (I honestly don’t know what that means) and projects 2025 revenue to be €30-€35B (€28B is projected for calendar year 2024). 

This stock hit nearly $1,100 about six months ago. It’s down to ~$650. Their lithography equipment is required for AI. 

If you’re betting on AI then how can you not bet on this company which serves as the only pick and shovel in town? 

I don’t own any shares and I am not a savvy stock person. I just buy shares like an idiot. But this community sometimes has great advice that’s made me wild gains.

https://preview.redd.it/uk6avgdxk82e1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4f4c143b906eb1c7d17a4e519c148a1ef279e28

I am long this synthetic long position at a 10-3 ratio, meaning I am long 10 calls for each 3 short puts which I sold to finance the position. I am still at net debit, but much smaller if I just bought OTM calls.

The long calls are lottos which may or may not explode, but the short $4 puts are giving me long and sideways exposure to profit, as long as the stock is higher than $3.4. I picked this put strike because the insiders kept buying at these levels and there is margin of safety in the trade.

Good luck, trade small, and trade carefully.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to read the background on how insiders can show you when and how to double your money, see the original post and my follow up posts and trades. Here is a brief summary of my posts and trades:

1. VSTS - OG post, [posted on 5/10/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1coug3v/informed_traders_can_show_you_how_and_when_to/), stock was up a max 50% from the date
2. ATEC - [posted on 8/27/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f2qm8i/informed_traders_can_show_you_when_to_double_your/) the stock is now up 50% from the post date
3. PBF - [posted on 9/4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f92x8n/pbf_insiders_can_show_you_when_and_how_to_double/),  the stock is now down 5% form the post date

Interestingly, I made most money on PBF because I sold puts to recover the cost of the vertical spread, and I am still short $30 December puts. I made good money on ATEC even though my duration was short, and I barely made any money on the first trade on VSTS because it was a complex spread which did not work with the slow rise. This is just FIY on how you can use options but still make money in a sideways market, or lose money even if you pick the right direction, but you are wrong on duration.",wallstreetbets

As of Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock accounts for **2️⃣4️⃣**% of the index’s gains this year.

The result is that when Nvidia does well, animal spirits 🦍 rise across the market. Bank of America analysts had calculated this week that investors were expecting a **1% index move** in response to Nvidia’s earnings — greater than the shift they expect from US inflation data later this month.

 In the short term, Nvidia has the enviable benefits of both scale and scarcity. 

Supply constraints keep prices high, and the company says demand for its new Blackwell chips will exceed its expectations of 'several billion dollars' in the current quarter. 

💸 Meanwhile, governments from Saudi Arabia to Denmark are seeking to build their own state-backed artificial intelligence initiatives, so while Silicon Valley depends on Nvidia, the reverse is becoming less true.

 That suggests the virtuous circle can continue. Whether that justifies a valuation of **3️⃣4️⃣** times forward earnings is up for grabs. Cisco stock, after a moment on top of the world, plunged during the dotcom crash, and never recovered.

 While Nvidia’s customers are paying hand over fist for chips driven by the promise of AI, it remains to be seen whether their customers — and their customers’ customers — will pay up for the resulting services too.💡

Nvidia has two things in its favour. First, its valuation is far behind the **1️⃣3️⃣0️⃣** times earnings Cisco enjoyed in 2000. Second, Huang has the benefit of hindsight and lavish profitability. Cisco’s earnings were **2️⃣0️⃣**% of its sales before the dotcom crash; Nvidia’s are nearly **6️⃣0️⃣**%.

 Spend that wisely, and his company will move the market for some time to come.""(+++Opinions are my own. Not investment advice. Do your own research.+++)",wallstreetbets

> The coffee chain has been speaking to advisers about ways to grow its operations in China including the potential introduction of a local partner, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. It has informally gauged interest from prospective investors, including domestic private equity firms, the people said.

> A stake sale could also attract interest from Chinese conglomerates or other local companies with experience in the industry, some of the people said. Starbucks is still evaluating its options and hasn’t made a decision about whether to proceed, the people said. 

> Starbucks has faced pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management, which wants it to commit to reviewing its Chinese business, Bloomberg News has reported. In previous years, McDonald’s Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc. have carved out their Chinese operations and sold stakes to private equity firms to tap more growth and better cater to local tastes. 

> China is the second-biggest market globally for Starbucks and generated about $3 billion of net revenue in the most recent financial year, when the company increased its store count in the country by 12%.

1732129689.0,$RIVN: Riding to Valhalla,"Alright, degenerates. Rivian isn’t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore—it’s the ex-nerd who’s going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you’re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.

## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver

**Tesla’s Fumbling the Ball** 

Elon’s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they’re turning the corner to RIVN, who’s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla’s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian’s already at brunch ordering mimosas.

**How Rivian Could Ride Trump’s EV Rollercoaster**

You’d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here’s the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely “America First” policies. With Rivian’s production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump’s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian’s set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone’s FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it’s only a matter of time until the market realizes this.

**New Models That’ll Make You Feel Things** 

Let’s talk about Rivian’s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it’s the hot-but-affordable option that’s ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla’s Supercharger network? That’s not just sexy—that’s full-blown EV porn. This isn’t a one-night stand; Rivian’s building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn’t inclusive enough for you Wendy’s employees, they’re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).

**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** 

Sure, Rivian’s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they’ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they’ve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That’s efficiency, baby.

**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**

 Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They’re hyped about Rivian’s leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.

RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they’re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company’s market cap isn’t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they’re only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian’s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW’s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian’s like the guy spending money he doesn’t have to impress his date. Sure, it’s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it’s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he’s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that’s all he talks about? Hell no, he’ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn’t just another EV play—it’s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian’s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock’s the real deal, and I’m strapping in for the ride.
